The president of DF@@ B Grin@@ del sees no basis for the returning of Ö@@ zil
Berlin - The president of DF@@ B Reinhard Grin@@ del sees no basis for the returning of Mes@@ ut Ö@@ zil to the national team@@ .
There is an open question so you get into a convers@@ ation@@ , you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way@@ , how is stated in his state@@ ment@@ , said Grin@@ del in football Podcast "@@ Phra@@ sen@@ mä@@ her@@ " of the newspaper "@@ Bild@@ -@@ Zeit@@ ung@@ "@@ .
In spite of the debate going on for months about the photos of Ö@@ zil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan@@ , he regrets the return of the 9@@ 2@@ -@@ match national player Ö@@ z@@ il@@ .
I would be happy if Mes@@ ut Ö@@ zil continued to play for German@@ y@@ .
At some point of time I also assumed that it will happ@@ en@@ , said Grindel@@ .
The 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old had declared that he qu@@ its DF@@ B team in July and explained it with the fact that Grin@@ del did not protect him against racist hostility during the World C@@ up@@ .
The DF@@ B head repeated his criticism of Ö@@ zil and that he is not ready for a discussion with national coach and team manager Oliver Bier@@ hoff@@ .
He did not want to create any pres@@ su@@ re@@ , but he knows that in football ‘@@ if you leave a team or change club@@ , you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that this discussion did not happen before@@ ’@@ .

Audi@@ : "@@ Diesel@@ g@@ ate@@ " regeneration takes longer than planned
There is still a diesel tas@@ k@@ for@@ ce@@ , said Peter Mer@@ ten@@ s@@ , chief development officer from the ‘@@ Automobil@@ wo@@ che@@ ’ trade journ@@ al@@ .
In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stad@@ ler had announ@@ c@@ ed@@ , the tas@@ k@@ force will be dissolved so@@ on@@ .
In the first quarter of 2018 all engine@@ /@@ transmission combinations will have been check@@ ed@@ , he said at the time@@ .
Mer@@ tens now sa@@ ys@@ : ‘@@ At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked out@@ .
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our V@@ TDI eng@@ ines@@ .
The tas@@ k@@ force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery at Audi parent company Volks@@ wagen@@ .
Mer@@ tens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘@@ seri@@ ous@@ , organizational chan@@ ges@@ ’@@ , to prevent such a scandal ever happening aga@@ in@@ .
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stad@@ ler@@ '@@ s future on Friday and will continue this discussion on Tu@@ es@@ day@@ .
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi bo@@ ss@@ , following awareness of exhaust emission che@@ at@@ ing@@ , of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission valu@@ es@@ .
He must have known about the tam@@ pering or deliberately ignored it@@ .
Cur@@ rently the Sales Director Bra@@ m Sch@@ ot heads the company as Ac@@ ting Chief Executive Offic@@ er@@ .
After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard W@@ LT@@ P@@ , there were production losses at Audi@@ , Sch@@ ot told the ‘@@ Heil@@ bron@@ ner Stim@@ me@@ ’@@ .
Essenti@@ all@@ y@@ , he sees a falling demand for limou@@ sin@@ es such as the Audi models A@@ 6@@ , A7 and A@@ 8@@ , produced in Nec@@ kar@@ sul@@ m.

Grin@@ del seeking re@@ -@@ election - Lah@@ m to join the Presidential Board of the German football association (@@ DF@@ B@@ )
Mainz (@@ d@@ pa@@ ) - Des@@ p@@ ite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mes@@ ut Ö@@ z@@ il@@ , Reinhard Grin@@ del wants to run for office as President of the DF@@ B again in the coming year@@ .
I do my work and try to make it as good as it ge@@ ts@@ , said Grin@@ del as a guest early Sunday morning on Z@@ DF@@ ’@@ s weekly sports broadcast "@@ Das aktuelle Sport@@ studi@@ o@@ "@@ .
A re@@ -@@ election should be attempted and that is what I will do@@ .
And then you have to see what kind of support you get@@ .
In his own wor@@ ds@@ , the head of the association would find it "@@ stran@@ ge@@ " if he did not "@@ feel like working on the future projec@@ t@@ " after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 20@@ 24.
Since April 201@@ 6@@ , Grin@@ del has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach@@ , who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in German@@ y@@ .
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three year@@ s.
The next vote will be held at the DF@@ B@@ ’@@ s national conference on September 27@@ , 20@@ 19.
According to Grindel@@ , the future head organizer of the 20@@ 24 European Football Championship in German@@ y@@ , Philipp Lah@@ m@@ , is to join the DF@@ B Presidential Board@@ .
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting mat@@ ters@@ , said Grindel@@ .
At the same time@@ , he did not want to specul@@ ate as to whether or not Lah@@ m could succeed him as head of the DF@@ B.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mes@@ ut Ö@@ zil and Il@@ kay Gün@@ do@@ gan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan@@ , Grin@@ del expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DF@@ B ambassador for integr@@ ation@@ .
Cur@@ rent@@ ly@@ , this position is filled by native Brazilian Cac@@ au and C@@ elia Sa@@ si@@ c@@ , who traces her family back to Camero@@ on@@ .
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influ@@ encer in society and football and sa@@ ys@@ , ‘@@ the issue is an important one@@ , we need to do something about it@@ ’@@ , ‘@@ this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local team@@ s@@ , where integration needs to work@@ ’@@ , Grin@@ del sa@@ i@@ d.

Freedom of Press@@ : Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Ste@@ ffen Sei@@ bert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (@@ CD@@ U@@ ) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğ@@ an@@ .
In the chancell@@ ery@@ , the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T@@ -@@ shirt with the Turkish and German writing “@@ Freedom for journ@@ ali@@ st@@ s@@ ” and was sitting in the first ro@@ w.
The T@@ -@@ shirt was not the problem@@ , Sei@@ bert said to the Bild on Sun@@ day@@ .
It was about a disruption in the course of the press confer@@ ence@@ .
The journ@@ ali@@ st@@ ’@@ s action created a lot of un@@ rest@@ , which was unaccep@@ table@@ .
Th@@ us@@ , he ordered body@@ guards to escort the man out@@ .
Sei@@ bert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the federal chancell@@ ery@@ .
no matter if it is a legitimate concern or not@@ .
The rules are the rul@@ es@@ .
In Tur@@ key@@ , many journalists are imprison@@ ed@@ .
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len mo@@ ve@@ ment@@ .
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for the failed attempted coup on July 15@@ , 201@@ 6.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in j@@ ail@@ .
Even foreign journalists are not safe from Turkish authori@@ ti@@ es@@ : At the beginning of Sept@@ ember@@ , the Austrian journalist Max Zir@@ n@@ gast was ar@@ rest@@ ed@@ .
Most rec@@ ent@@ ly@@ , the cases of the incar@@ cer@@ ated journalists Me@@ ş@@ ale Tol@@ u and Deni@@ z Y@@ ü@@ cel caused a sti@@ r.
They were released and were able to return to German@@ y@@ , but the legal processes in Turkey against the two are still on@@ go@@ ing@@ .




Muni@@ ch@@ : Florian David Fit@@ z completely drunk with In@@ a Müller
His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good look@@ ing@@ : Florian David Fit@@ z.
You have to look twi@@ ce@@ , thou@@ gh@@ : Y@@ es@@ , th@@ at@@ '@@ s really Florian David Fit@@ z.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night@@ !
Hamburg - The talk show “@@ In@@ as Nacht@@ ” [@@ In@@ a@@ '@@ s Night@@ ] produced by N@@ DR is known for its che@@ ery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “@@ Schell@@ fisch@@ po@@ sten@@ .@@ ”
Moderator In@@ a Müller often che@@ ers her guests with a beer@@ , some wine or even stronger beverages to loo@@ sen up the mood and their ton@@ gu@@ es@@ .
Qu@@ ite a few celeb@@ s also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number@@ .
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Fri@@ day@@ .
This time@@ : The actor Florian David Fit@@ z known from films like "@@ Männer@@ her@@ zen@@ "@@ , "@@ Terror - Ihr Ur@@ teil@@ " or "@@ Der gei@@ l@@ ste Tag@@ "@@ .
The trip did@@ n@@ ’@@ t do the actor any good@@ , thou@@ gh@@ .
On Satur@@ day@@ , he posted a sel@@ fi@@ e - his face completely cru@@ m@@ ple@@ d@@ , only two small sli@@ ts for ey@@ es@@ .
The bed sel@@ fi@@ e showed a completely dra@@ ined Florian David Fit@@ z.
But he is not ill@@ , he only has quite a han@@ go@@ ver@@ .
Ad@@ dressing his fan@@ s@@ , he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he lear@@ n@@ t@@ : "@@ Rule one@@ : NEV@@ ER go to In@@ as Night@@ .
Rule two@@ : Ne@@ ver drink "@@ die schwarze Sau@@ "@@ .
And Sprit@@ z.
And also pass on In@@ a@@ ’@@ s round of e@@ gg@@ nog at half past tw@@ o.@@ "
The long night is really showing on the 43@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds@@ ’ fac@@ e.
His fans posted a couple of tips for getting rid of a han@@ go@@ ver@@ .
They ranged from instant bro@@ th@@ , fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - pain@@ k@@ iller@@ s.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star@@ .
We still don@@ '@@ t know how In@@ a Müller survived the bin@@ ge drinking at night@@ .
Since she has hosted the wild TV fun at the bar since 2007@@ , the 53@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old seems to be much better prep@@ are@@ d@@ ...

Tre@@ y@@ sa has struggled against van@@ dali@@ sm and garbage
Acc@@ essing the 36@@ -@@ kilometer cycle track in Rot@@ kä@@ pp@@ chen@@ land in Tre@@ y@@ sa is very difficult and heavily litter@@ ed@@ .
Att@@ emp@@ ts are made to remedy the rampant van@@ dali@@ sm@@ , but there are hardly any signs of solu@@ tions@@ .
Shar@@ ds@@ , cigarette but@@ ts@@ , garbage and rub@@ bis@@ h@@ , demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Ha@@ a@@ ß@@ e@@ -@@ hill in Tre@@ y@@ sa@@ .
The sight of the bicycle path@@ , which is the flagship object in Rot@@ kä@@ p@@ chen@@ land@@ , is more than ing@@ l@@ ori@@ ous@@ .
The matter is of concern to the AD@@ FC (@@ German Cy@@ cli@@ sts Associ@@ ation@@ ) chapter Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ stadt@@ , but others have also taken interest for some time@@ , according to the city@@ '@@ s cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüsten@@ ha@@ gen@@ .
The problem has already been addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body@@ .
There is no solution so far@@ .
Su@@ g@@ ges@@ tions ranged from transferring the seating area to the regular emp@@ tying of garbage can@@ s@@ , and cleaning the point of entry are@@ as@@ .
I thin@@ k@@ , the latter would be the order of the day@@ , irrespective of any further activi@@ ti@@ es@@ , says Wüsten@@ ha@@ gen@@ .
Guido Hahn (@@ AD@@ FC@@ ) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory coun@@ ci@@ l.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular meeting place for part@@ y@@ ing@@ .
It is not just about the nois@@ e@@ , there are also disturbances due to parti@@ es@@ : Po@@ sts pulled out of the ground@@ , garbage cans w@@ reck@@ ed@@ , signs sn@@ apped and seating dau@@ bed@@ .
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up@@ , explains the AD@@ FC member Susanne Kli@@ pper@@ t.
Actions are only pro@@ ver@@ bial drops in the oce@@ an@@ .
They are anno@@ yed that the rest area at the cycle track in Tre@@ y@@ sa is a meeting point for bin@@ ge@@ -@@ drin@@ king@@ .
Cle@@ arly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Ha@@ a@@ ß@@ e@@ , confirms the cycling commission@@ er@@ , who now is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegen@@ ha@@ in@@ , which will be opened to@@ day@@ .
If it suffers the same f@@ ate@@ , it will cost de@@ ar@@ ly@@ .
Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill@@ : "@@ Po@@ ssi@@ bly this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common proper@@ ty@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , this would require a police patrol to come out@@ .
In prin@@ ci@@ ple@@ , Wüsten@@ hagen supports the development of the Ha@@ a@@ ße hill@@ .
It needs to be made more attrac@@ ti@@ ve@@ .
So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequ@@ ent@@ ed@@ .
It is still possible to develop tour@@ ism@@ -@@ related market@@ ing@@ .
Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German@@ ’@@ , agreed the AD@@ FC member@@ s.
AD@@ FC member Susanne Kli@@ pper@@ t considers the situation in the A@@ scher@@ ö@@ der Strasse in Tre@@ y@@ sa to be critically danger@@ ous@@ .
There is no turning lane on Ha@@ a@@ ße Hügel@@ .
In heavy traff@@ ic@@ , cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bi@@ directional traffic flow@@ s@@ "@@ , she expla@@ ins@@ .
That would not be a problem for sporty cycli@@ st@@ s@@ , but is for older people and especially for chil@@ dren@@ .




Music contest at the culture train station@@ : The "@@ K@@ ö von Hil@@ tru@@ p@@ " and the sea
The first call to participate in the music contest was a success@@ , creative and co@@ oper@@ ati@@ ve@@ .
Your Song for Hil@@ tru@@ p is the motto of the Hil@@ tru@@ p initiative for the "@@ Music Contest for young and old@@ , new and experienced musi@@ ci@@ ans@@ .@@ "
A contest "@@ with a win@@ k from the lovely Hil@@ tru@@ p famil@@ y@@ "@@ , as Karl Fran@@ ke worded it@@ .
In fac@@ t@@ , it soon became a famili@@ al toge@@ th@@ erness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kultur@@ bahn@@ ho@@ f.
Seven acts perform@@ ed@@ , from a one@@ -@@ man band to the big ensem@@ ble@@ : Al@@ vin Ja@@ sic with pianist Marcel Un@@ ti@@ ed@@ , Hen@@ k Hum@@ berg with his guitar@@ , Rolf Ih@@ mi@@ g@@ , an old@@ -@@ established Hil@@ tru@@ p man@@ , the "@@ Hil@@ tru@@ per Stern@@ farben@@ "@@ , three members from three generations of the Tren@@ kamp and Claus famili@@ es@@ , an ensemble from the kindergarten Lum@@ mer@@ land and finally Ri@@ ke We@@ ß@@ ling und die Z@@ war@@ ti@@ es@@ .
This contest is a novel@@ ty@@ , explains district mayor Joachim Schmid@@ t.
We have not seen something like this in other di@@ stric@@ ts@@ .
What did the song@@ writers sing ab@@ out@@ ?
Par@@ tic@@ ularly popular places were the Hil@@ tru@@ p lake and Markt@@ alle@@ e.
Rolf Ih@@ mig dedicated the song to the avenue Markt@@ alle in his fol@@ k@@ -@@ like song "@@ K@@ ö von Hil@@ tru@@ p@@ "@@ .
The Kultur@@ bahnhof was also men@@ tion@@ ed@@ .
Over and over aga@@ in@@ , the acts sang about experiencing toge@@ th@@ erness in these plac@@ es@@ , especially Al@@ vin J@@ asi@@ c.
Karl Fran@@ ke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the arti@@ st@@ s.
Th@@ us@@ , the audience learnt that Hum@@ berg that he had actually studied chemi@@ str@@ y@@ , but now also teaches guitar@@ .
From the sound engineer Stefan Schem@@ mel@@ mann Fran@@ ke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Bar@@ clay James Har@@ vest as a main act@@ .
And Al@@ vin Ja@@ sic has uploaded a lot of YouTube video@@ s.
It@@ ’@@ s not about winn@@ ing@@ , Fran@@ ke had sa@@ i@@ d.
In fac@@ t@@ , all participants received a gift from Hil@@ tru@@ p catering business@@ es@@ .
For the jur@@ y@@ '@@ s favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their son@@ gs@@ .
Al@@ vin Ja@@ sic and his pianist Marcel Un@@ tied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schem@@ mel@@ mann@@ .
Other musicians can record a song@@ : Ih@@ mig with his Hil@@ tru@@ p hit@@ , which especially impressed Fran@@ ke with his musi@@ cali@@ ty@@ , and the “@@ Lum@@ mer@@ land pack@@ :@@ ” “@@ a very good perform@@ ance@@ ” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and ca@@ j@@ ó@@ n@@ , Laura Kast@@ ner and L@@ ina T@@ öl@@ le@@ .
Like everyone else@@ , the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic sup@@ port@@ , they sounded "@@ really good@@ ,@@ " Fran@@ ke sa@@ i@@ d.
The jury was guided by the aspects of origin@@ ali@@ ty@@ , reference to Hil@@ tru@@ p@@ , cat@@ ch@@ iness of the melody and recognition valu@@ e.
The jury included Gis@@ bert Keller from the Westpha@@ lian School of Music@@ , Andreas Kl@@ om@@ fa@@ ß from K@@ v@@ G@@ -@@ Gymnasium and Oliver Ah@@ lers from the Trade Association as well as Jan K@@ aven@@ , chairman of the district offen@@ si@@ ve@@ .
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten@@ -@@ year anni@@ vers@@ ary@@ .
They considered the event a complete success@@ .
Every@@ one was "@@ very satis@@ fi@@ ed@@ ,@@ " and "@@ the atmosphere was good@@ " in the very crowded Kultur@@ bahn@@ ho@@ f.

For ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , on the cards it says to read from left to right@@ : "@@ 1. Renaissanc@@ e.
2. Fenster@@ .
3. Cu@@ be@@ .
4. Solid@@ ʺ@@ .
These are the terms that need to be code@@ d.
So the terms are not gu@@ es@@ sed@@ , the codes are@@ .
Tak@@ ing turn@@ s@@ , one player per team is the encryp@@ tor@@ .
They get a code card that has "@@ 3.@@ 4.@@ 2.@@ " etc. written on it@@ .
In "@@ Dec@@ r@@ ypto@@ ,@@ " it is not the words behind the secret film that should be gu@@ es@@ sed@@ , but their encryption co@@ des@@ .
The task in this cas@@ e@@ : They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "@@ cu@@ be@@ "@@ , "@@ soli@@ d@@ " and "@@ win@@ dow@@ " - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not@@ , because the team that cracks the code twice wins the g@@ ame@@ .
The encryp@@ tor writes down and reads al@@ ou@@ d@@ : "@@ Thro@@ w@@ " for the dic@@ e@@ , "@@ loo@@ se@@ " as opposed to "@@ soli@@ d@@ "@@ . Of cour@@ se@@ , something like "@@ eviden@@ ce@@ " would be possible or "@@ Pra@@ gu@@ e@@ " because he read some history books and knows about the defen@@ est@@ ration of Pra@@ gu@@ e.
This then progre@@ ss@@ es@@ , round for round@@ , team by team@@ .
It is true that one does not know the terms of the other side - but with every clu@@ e the encryp@@ tor gi@@ ves@@ , you@@ ’@@ re closer to finding them out@@ .
So the term should be as mysterious as possi@@ ble@@ , but not too cra@@ zy@@ . O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e@@ , you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team@@ .
The most cryp@@ tic ‘@@ Dec@@ r@@ ypto@@ ’ is the prec@@ ept un@@ fortun@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ .
The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail@@ , until they can finally play it@@ .
The explanatory video under dec@@ r@@ ypto@@ .info on the web will make it easi@@ er@@ .
But once you have star@@ ted@@ , you@@ ’@@ ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this non@@ descri@@ pt g@@ ame@@ .
Over@@ all@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , "@@ Dec@@ r@@ ypto@@ " is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and gen@@ re@@ -@@ prim@@ us "@@ Co@@ den@@ am@@ es@@ "@@ , which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few wor@@ ds@@ , but it@@ ’@@ s much easier to play in small group@@ s.
And if it@@ '@@ s all about gu@@ essing and not about winn@@ ing@@ , it@@ '@@ s easy to play a version for tw@@ o.




Kul@@ mb@@ ach@@ : Man gives police the Hitler salute and har@@ asses guests in the pub
During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kul@@ mb@@ ach twice something to do@@ .
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the upper town@@ , later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he harass@@ ed other guest@@ s.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply with the police order to vac@@ ate the pre@@ mis@@ es@@ , he had to spend the night in the detention cell in the police station of Kul@@ mb@@ ach@@ .
In the sober state@@ , he also had to take legal responsibility for the use of symbols of un@@ constitutional organis@@ ations@@ .




The Pre@@ ssig de@@ pot@@ was home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pre@@ ssig was the hub of the Fran@@ conian Forest@@ .
1991 put an end to a piece of railway histor@@ y@@ .
The cra@@ shing from bump@@ er to bump@@ er could be heard throughout Pre@@ ssi@@ g@@ , remembers Georg Din@@ kel@@ , who archives the history of the place and the st@@ ations@@ .
This did not bother any@@ body@@ .
The squ@@ e@@ aking of brakes and ratt@@ ling of carriages could also be he@@ ard@@ .
This was pure rail@@ way@@ .
Statements that are symbolic for Din@@ kel@@ ’@@ s Pre@@ ssig hom@@ el@@ and@@ .
No@@ where in the Fran@@ conian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so mu@@ ch.
This was the starting point for the steep mountain section to the north@@ , which peaks in Stein@@ bach am Wald following an ascen@@ sion of about 220 me@@ ters@@ .
Pre@@ vi@@ ously trains and locomotives housed in Pre@@ ssig were needed to handle th@@ is@@ .
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomo@@ tiv@@ es@@ , appr@@ entice work@@ shop@@ s@@ , cat@@ en@@ ary and railroad maintenance divi@@ sion@@ .
The center@@ piece was the turn@@ table@@ , which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 met@@ res@@ , says Norbert Hei@@ drich from Hirsch@@ ai@@ d@@ , a railway historian and a professional rail@@ ro@@ ader with 47 years of experi@@ ence@@ .
The Pre@@ ssig de@@ pot@@ , which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bam@@ berg@@ , also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pre@@ ssig - T@@ ett@@ au@@ , Ludwigs@@ stadt - Leh@@ est@@ en@@ , Stock@@ heim - Son@@ ne@@ berg and Kron@@ ach - Nord@@ hal@@ ben@@ .
On July 15 1950 the "@@ Volks@@ blat@@ t@@ " reported of a staff of 160 men@@ ; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pre@@ ssig at that time@@ .
The electri@@ fication of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomo@@ tiv@@ es@@ .
From 1977 they were still used with freight tra@@ ins@@ .
By 1991 at least 10,000 wagons were sh@@ un@@ te@@ d.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the remainder in the year 199@@ 1.
Hei@@ dri@@ ch@@ : ‘@@ It@@ ’@@ s a shame that better use of the location is not envis@@ age@@ d@@ , also with regard to freight traff@@ ic@@ ’@@ .
Still in the year 1989 at Pent@@ ec@@ ost@@ , the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "@@ 50 years of electri@@ fication Nuremberg - Saal@@ feld@@ " with a pom@@ p@@ ous station festival for the anniversary in Pre@@ ssi@@ g.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here@@ , remembers Georg Din@@ kel@@ .
Shor@@ tly after@@ ward@@ s.
On June 1@@ , 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pre@@ ssig marsh@@ alling yard was histor@@ y@@ .
The sh@@ unters and wheel sc@@ ot@@ ches took care of the heavi@@ est rail traffic work@@ , remembers Din@@ kel@@ .
Each mistake could have fatal consequ@@ en@@ ces@@ .

On the weekend as part of the "@@ Art and En@@ joy@@ ment@@ " seri@@ es@@ , a special exhibition was opened in Mittel@@ ehren@@ bach@@ .
Organis@@ ers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vern@@ is@@ sage of the "@@ Wind@@ spiel@@ -@@ Perform@@ ance@@ " which took place in the open air on the D@@ ahl@@ mann@@ -@@ Schmidt property in Mittel@@ ehren@@ bach@@ .
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "@@ R@@ und ums Wal@@ ber@@ la@@ " (@@ A@@ round Wal@@ ber@@ la@@ ) in the framework of the series "@@ Art and En@@ joy@@ ment@@ "@@ .
This opened its doors for the 15th year@@ .
The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibit@@ s.
21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittel@@ ehren@@ bach@@ .
The host Jürgen D@@ ahl@@ mann welcomed the artists at the opening of the ex@@ hibi@@ tion@@ .
He had been there from the first hour@@ .
As has Volker H@@ ahn@@ , who has made a name for himself as the main organiser as well as an arti@@ st@@ .
It was a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement some days ag@@ o.
With T@@ ania Engel@@ ke and Kurt Neu@@ bauer he put his task in experi@@ enc@@ ed@@ , young hands with excellent future prospec@@ ts@@ .
In the past@@ , both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing fl@@ yer@@ s.
Once again this year there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (@@ art and enjo@@ y@@ ment@@ )@@ , available at every art station@@ .
The poster this year ‘@@ out@@ dance the B@@ etz@@ n@@ ’@@ , designed by Volker H@@ ahn@@ , can be purchased for eight euro@@ s.
Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception of the special exhibit@@ .
It was possible to persuade Max Marcus Stad@@ ler from Nuremberg to provide musical fra@@ ming@@ .
The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "@@ Wind@@ spiel@@ -@@ Perform@@ ance@@ " literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way@@ .
There are metal or ceramic works of art@@ , often acc@@ ented with color@@ .
Al@@ ready at the entrance to the proper@@ ty@@ , on the right side@@ , the visitor is awaited by the "@@ Glücks@@ baum@@ " (@@ luck tre@@ e@@ ) by the artist Werner Bau@@ r@@ , E@@ schen@@ au@@ .
It is a tree stum@@ p@@ , brigh@@ tened with color@@ , equipped with 20 pin whe@@ els@@ , 24 hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es and 24 aluminum tubes for a sound piec@@ e.
The sun shining through the bushes in the background adds a magical touch to the objec@@ t@@ , inviting visitors to ling@@ er@@ .
Barbara Wasch@@ neck comes from Eck@@ ental and prefers to dedicate thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional letters to the event 15 years K@@ &@@ G.
There are many parts moving in the win@@ d.
Hal@@ f@@ way through the path Sie@@ grid Fre@@ y from Eck@@ ental exhibited her work "@@ Der Wind das himm@@ lische Kind@@ " (@@ The Wind the He@@ avenly Chil@@ d@@ )@@ .
At the end@@ , Volker Hahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from cla@@ y@@ , cement and stainless steel@@ .
The ‘@@ wind chim@@ e perform@@ ance@@ ’ theme wander@@ s through the multi@@ -@@ purpose art ex@@ hibi@@ tion@@ .
The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31@@ , 201@@ 8.




50 years of M@@ GV 68 Al@@ ba@@ cht@@ en@@ : Sing@@ ers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - That was the time of the protest and the student mo@@ ve@@ ment@@ .
And also the people of Alb@@ achten demonstrated their an@@ ger@@ .
At least five of them@@ .
In no case did they want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "@@ C@@ ä@@ ci@@ lia@@ " there would be no more singing life in the di@@ stric@@ t.
It has become a legend by now@@ : At a bank in T@@ innen@@ bu@@ sch@@ , the M@@ GV 68 came to exist@@ ence@@ .
That was 50 years ag@@ o.
Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in the “@@ House of En@@ counter@@ .@@ ”
It will be full to@@ day@@ , senses chairman Jürgen Hol@@ stie@@ ge@@ , and he was right@@ .
There are 150 guest@@ s@@ , a real success for the Alb@@ achten sin@@ ger@@ .
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anni@@ vers@@ ary@@ .
It was a tradition for year@@ s@@ , and then there was a break for the first time@@ .
The traditional festival was back again in time for the 50th anni@@ vers@@ ary@@ .
It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested before@@ hand@@ .
Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “@@ House of En@@ counter@@ ,@@ ” but rather sat comfortably around tab@@ les@@ .
In bet@@ we@@ en@@ , everyone could dan@@ ce@@ . DJ Matthias Dre@@ es from Nott@@ ul@@ n put on the controls and heated up the dance floor@@ .
Of cour@@ se@@ , the singers of the M@@ GV 68 Alb@@ achten would let their voices sound@@ .
Matching the occa@@ sion@@ , happy songs were quite fit@@ ting@@ .
Al@@ most set@@ : "@@ So ein Tag@@ , so wunderschön wie heu@@ te@@ .@@ "
There was also the “@@ Rü@@ des@@ heim win@@ e@@ ” to go with the exquisite grape ju@@ ice@@ , which many guests had in front of them@@ .
“@@ Hum@@ ul@@ us lu@@ pul@@ us@@ ,@@ ” which is the Latin name for ‘@@ hop@@ s@@ ,@@ ’ references another cool drin@@ k.
The choir direction of Richard Hom@@ ann@@ , who is one of the five who were in T@@ innen@@ bus@@ ch back th@@ en@@ , was once again very confi@@ dent@@ .
It@@ '@@ s just fun to sing under his direc@@ tion@@ , said Hol@@ stie@@ ge@@ . "@@ He has such an easy way@@ , he accompli@@ shes a masterpiece every time@@ .@@ "@@ . By the way@@ , this time not only men were presented vo@@ call@@ y@@ .
The la@@ dies@@ ’ choir “@@ High C@@ ” were also guest@@ s@@ , whose repertoire above all includes ever@@ greens from the 20s to the 60@@ s.
To round it all off there was some po@@ et@@ ry@@ .
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own r@@ hy@@ mes@@ .
And Andreas Winter@@ hoff also presented melodic po@@ et@@ ry@@ .
There was also a big Tom@@ b@@ ola g@@ ame@@ .
The proceeds are to go towards financing the children of the Alb@@ at@@ ros Youth Center visiting the all@@ -@@ weather z@@ oo@@ .

After just three mat@@ ch@@ da@@ ys@@ , it does not seem foreseeable where the indepen@@ dent@@ s@@ ’ journey go@@ es@@ .
It@@ ’@@ s simply too early for th@@ at@@ , says Axel Bür@@ ing@@ .
He only feels v@@ indicated in one th@@ ing@@ : “@@ The 3rd W@@ omen@@ '@@ s League has an unbelie@@ vably good level of play@@ .
It@@ ’@@ s not even close with regional league vol@@ ley@@ ball@@ .@@ ” They don@@ '@@ t even want to look down towards the fourth le@@ ag@@ ue@@ .

But a conclusion can@@ '@@ t be drawn until after ten or eleven gam@@ es@@ .

About her marriage to Hans von Bor@@ so@@ dy@@ : Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for her husband
The "@@ Dream Ship@@ " made Heide Keller a star@@ .
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Bor@@ so@@ dy@@ .
Heide Keller (@@ 76@@ ) became famous in her role as chief host@@ ess Beatrice von Le@@ debu@@ r on the ‘@@ Dream Bo@@ at@@ ’@@ , but on 01 January 2018 she dis@@ embarked fore@@ ver@@ .
The series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Bor@@ so@@ dy (@@ 1929 - 201@@ 3@@ )@@ , to whom she had been married for ten year@@ s.
This could also have been a reason@@ .
Bec@@ ause this work became a part of me@@ , I traveled around the world with a suit@@ case alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equ@@ al@@ , explained Keller in the interview to "@@ Bild am Sonn@@ tag@@ "@@ .
She used to be "@@ the wife of Hans von Bor@@ so@@ dy@@ "@@ , but that had changed with the "@@ Dream Ship@@ "@@ .
Bec@@ ause now journalists called her only as Heide Keller@@ .
I don@@ ’@@ t know if he was happy with th@@ is@@ .
She thinks that it possible that her husband might have been je@@ alous at the time@@ , but "@@ as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s.@@ "
Keller always made effort for Hans von Bor@@ so@@ dy "@@ and he did not want to discover my fears and my weak@@ ness@@ es@@ .
In plain language it me@@ ans@@ : I@@ ’@@ m preten@@ ding@@ ,@@ " as she explains further@@ .
She always had the feeling of ‘@@ not being enough for hi@@ m.
He saw in me an emancip@@ ated wom@@ an@@ , which actually I never was@@ , even though I sometimes appeared che@@ ek@@ y and courageous on sta@@ ge@@ .
I wanted our love to last fore@@ ver@@ ’@@ .
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Här@@ tn@@ er@@ , Keller said ‘@@ Y@@ es@@ ’ aga@@ in@@ , ‘@@ although I was scared it could go wrong aga@@ in@@ ’@@ .
The day before the civil marri@@ age@@ , I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cancel every@@ th@@ ing@@ .
The marriage to von Bor@@ so@@ dy failed as well@@ .
Why did it never work out with men@@ ?
Bec@@ ause I wanted too mu@@ ch.
Keller was in love at that time "@@ as in the mo@@ vie@@ .
Un@@ fortun@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ , this vision is not compatible with daily life@@ .
I am too naive to approach lo@@ ve@@ .@@ "




The mo@@ th@@ , who regularly explores the city nightlife in the NZ@@ Z Zurich are@@ a@@ , has now attempted this on the Z@@ FF opening part@@ y@@ .
Not really a mo@@ th@@ , just a little sha@@ dy@@ .
And the shiny gla@@ re@@ , in which a green carpet is bath@@ ed in@@ , on the Se@@ chsel@@ ä@@ uten@@ platz@@ , blinds him over the char@@ ge@@ .
It is the film festival thou@@ gh@@ , where the more or less famous want to bathe in the spot@@ light@@ .
So this late Thursday evening he tot@@ tered across the squ@@ are@@ , to briefly relieve himself in the "@@ Aqu@@ ac@@ lean toilet o@@ asi@@ s@@ "@@ .
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary comp@@ any@@ , which is being premi@@ ered at the festi@@ val@@ : The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambi@@ ence@@ .
This even@@ ing@@ , whatever the reason@@ , it literally stin@@ ks in the gents are@@ a.
So out of here@@ , over to the other side of the street@@ : Inv@@ ited guest@@ s@@ , who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film "@@ Green Book@@ "@@ , like every year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the thre@@ e@@ -@@ storey department store@@ .
Its name fits perfectly with this film festi@@ val@@ : It is well known that the works shown originate from the whole glo@@ be@@ .
What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festi@@ val@@ , so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner compani@@ es@@ .
The mot@@ h binds a ribbon around the fe@@ el@@ ers that a fairy god@@ mother has sent him@@ , and two be@@ ef@@ y door@@ men generously let him pass insi@@ de@@ .
In@@ side@@ , the invited are crowded toge@@ ther@@ , they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ@@ , to which they sh@@ out at each other@@ , and rin@@ se exquisite appetiz@@ ers down with a glass of ch@@ amp@@ ag@@ ne@@ .
In the delic@@ atessen in the basement o@@ yst@@ ers await sl@@ ur@@ ping mouth@@ s@@ , nearby the unparalleled Cul@@ at@@ ello di Zi@@ bello raw ham is freshly cut@@ , and a chocolate fountain bub@@ bles@@ .
And the highlight is@@ : that the shop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event@@ .
It has been like this for years and seems to function without any major lo@@ ss@@ es@@ .
You must just love the country for it@@ !
The mot@@ h studies the sign by the escal@@ ator@@ : "@@ Please be careful on the escal@@ ator if you are wearing a long dre@@ ss@@ "@@ .
Should this be two separate instruc@@ tions@@ , he has ignored the dress code@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , it is a conditional construction that has undoubtedly saved li@@ ves@@ .
In the household goods department on the upper floor@@ , the wing@@ ed man tips down a cocktail made with espresso called "@@ Golden Eye@@ "@@ , which is suited to the festival awar@@ d.
The mixture getting the prize for the best drin@@ k@@ , presented by a capsu@@ le manufacturer - not comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y@@ .
And George Clo@@ on@@ ey@@ , who has been advertising for the brand mentioned for year@@ s@@ , is also not there on the even@@ ing@@ .
There is one fac@@ e@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , between local not@@ ab@@ les@@ , cash desk and kitchen@@ ware@@ , that is familiar to the spect@@ ator@@ s@@ : Peter Far@@ rel@@ ly@@ , Director of the opening fil@@ m.
Its main character will not be far awa@@ y@@ .
And in reali@@ ty@@ : Im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ , Vig@@ go Mor@@ ten@@ sen@@ , who is almost sixty walks through the crowd appearing almost like a choir boy@@ .
He is not talked in@@ to@@ , not g@@ ap@@ ed at@@ , at the most he receives ste@@ al@@ thy glan@@ ces@@ .
This restra@@ int@@ , easily mistaken for in@@ hibi@@ tion@@ , is why the international stars love this film festi@@ val@@ .

Foot@@ ball@@ : District Le@@ ag@@ ue@@ : Strong appearance of Vf@@ L Wol@@ beck against the SC Alten@@ rh@@ eine gives hope
There were moments in this young season@@ , when Alois F@@ et@@ sch was really hard on his team@@ .
Sil@@ ent@@ ly@@ , the coach of the football district league club Vf@@ L Wol@@ beck first re@@ treated (@@ in@@ ward@@ ly@@ ) to pon@@ der over the lack of motivation on the playing fiel@@ d.
All is histor@@ y@@ .
Me@@ an@@ whi@@ le@@ , the game is on at Brand@@ ho@@ ve@@ we@@ g.
The 1@@ :@@ 1 on Sunday against SC Alten@@ rh@@ eine proved so@@ , and they almost got promoted past season@@ .
Y@@ es@@ , I am very happy with the appe@@ ar@@ anc@@ e.
We made tightened spaces and put pressure on the ball@@ .
That was something to be proud of@@ , praised F@@ et@@ sch his boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "@@ thank you@@ " for the great defense against the ambitious guest@@ s.
The coach had to change the system after 26 min@@ ut@@ es@@ .
Fol@@ lowing Nico Fr@@ eri@@ ch@@ '@@ s injury (@@ muscular problem@@ s@@ ) - for him came Luca Reh@@ berg - the 4@@ -@@ 4@@ -2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3@@ -1 in which Ni@@ kl@@ as The@@ wes was in the front line waiting for passes to hi@@ m.
Wol@@ beck had much more time of possession in the first hal@@ f.
And more opportunities
But Fr@@ eri@@ chs (@@ 17@@ )@@ , substitute Luca Reh@@ berg (@@ 26@@ m@@ ) and Jan Schro@@ er (@@ 38@@ th@@ ) missed the le@@ ad@@ .
It almost back@@ fired when SC@@ A@@ ’@@ s very own Kevin Voll@@ r@@ ath and Chris Nab@@ erb@@ äum@@ er made two dangerous attacks against Wol@@ be@@ cker in minute 4@@ 1@@ , but go@@ alie Dam@@ ian H@@ allas proved to be a master of his trade@@ .
After half@@ time@@ , Vf@@ L bol@@ dly took complete contro@@ l.
The@@ wes just barely failed with a shot from 18 me@@ ters@@ .
Schro@@ er was too late in minute 58 when The@@ wes passed him the ball@@ .
F@@ et@@ sch decided to fresh@@ en up the team on the left wing and put in Miles Ges@@ ke@@ .
As Alten@@ rhein@@ e@@ '@@ s Chris Nab@@ erb@@ äum@@ er cut down Robin Wes@@ th@@ ues in minute 70@@ , the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the go@@ al@@ .
The fou@@ led player himself stepped up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be in set play situ@@ ations@@ .
Wes@@ th@@ ues kicked the ball with his strong right and the go@@ alie had to face the fact that he had fai@@ le@@ d@@ : 1@@ :@@ 0 (@@ minute 7@@ 1@@ )@@ .
With 20 minutes left on the clock@@ , the game seemed to last fore@@ ver@@ .
Bec@@ ause then this happ@@ en@@ ed@@ : In minute 80@@ , Vf@@ L captain Florian Qu@@ abe@@ ck accidentally touched the ball in the box@@ .
Refer@@ ee Hü@@ se@@ y@@ in Sah@@ in (@@ Ham@@ m@@ ) immediately pointed to the poin@@ t.
J@@ annis Schneider was not ready to miss this opportunity (@@ minute 79@@ )@@ .
Wol@@ beck had to endure long minutes in the final sta@@ ge@@ , when Ges@@ ke finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and secure the winning goal in minute 8@@ 7.

All@@ Bright Foundation Re@@ port@@ : Women continue to be a r@@ arity on executive boards

The companies will have to make chan@@ ges@@ , otherwise international competitors will leave them behin@@ d@@ , said foundation CEO Wieb@@ ke Anker@@ sen@@ .
In the US@@ , UK@@ , or Swe@@ den@@ , mal@@ e@@ -@@ only management teams have - with a few exceptions - been unthinkable for some time@@ .
The gap makes the German competitors less diver@@ se@@ , innov@@ ati@@ ve@@ , and fut@@ ure@@ -@@ oriented by compar@@ ison@@ .
It is a different corporate cul@@ ture@@ .
The slight increase in the number of women in German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies in the mid@@ -@@ cap index (@@ M@@ Da@@ x@@ )@@ .
Y@@ et according to All@@ bright dat@@ a@@ , only 6.8 percent of boards are fem@@ ale@@ .
In the previous year the value was still at 3.8 percent@@ .
A@@ mon@@ g the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stag@@ nat@@ ed@@ .

I am sure that Dax companies will be recruiting women more consistently in the coming year - it is in their own best interest@@ , said Anker@@ sen@@ .
Only RWE and Heidelberg C@@ ement showed no commitment to increase the “@@ zero percent@@ ” to date@@ .
The supervisory boards paint a different pictu@@ re@@ : As of September 1@@ , the proportion of women was 30.@@ 5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ag@@ o.
If multiple women were recruited to the boards every year@@ , a percentage of 40 percent would be achieved in 20@@ 23@@ , it says in the re@@ port@@ .

On Sun@@ day@@ , Motor@@ cycle past@@ or Frank Schröder (@@ right@@ ) from Her@@ ne@@ , celebrated the concluding service with a team of hel@@ pers for motor@@ cyclists in the Frieden@@ skir@@ che in Ev@@ ek@@ ing@@ .
Wer@@ do@@ hl - The square in front of the Frieden@@ skir@@ che in Ev@@ ek@@ ing belonged to the motor@@ cyclists on Sun@@ day@@ .
After all@@ , the concluding service for the bikers was to be held here@@ .
Frank Schröder is the motor past@@ or in the Evangeli@@ cal church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastor@@ al interests of the high@@ -@@ HP cycli@@ st@@ s.
Between April and September on the last Sunday of the mon@@ th@@ , the traditional motorcycle service (@@ Mo@@ Go@@ ) takes place at Nord@@ helle house@@ .
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Frieden@@ skir@@ che in Ev@@ ek@@ ing@@ .
There@@ , some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday for a church service that was anything but ordin@@ ary@@ .
Star@@ ting from 10 am@@ , the heavy bikes lined up in front of the entrance portal of the chur@@ ch.
The bi@@ ker br@@ unch was the first agenda item and attendees had a chance to tu@@ ck into some coffee and cake or even a hearty Cur@@ ry@@ wur@@ st@@ .
In addition to the Mo@@ Go team@@ , the Holy Ri@@ der@@ s@@ , a Christian motorcycle group from Gum@@ mer@@ s@@ bach@@ , were also in atten@@ dan@@ ce@@ .

Fü@@ cht@@ or@@ f@@ '@@ s Home Association celebrates a major festi@@ val@@ : The milk comes after the apple
And Bor@@ isch was also active on the actual day of ac@@ tion@@ .
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple p@@ anc@@ ak@@ es@@ .
Georg Hart@@ mann@@ -@@ Ni@@ emer@@ g also aroused a big amount of interest@@ .
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the life of an apple to his astonished spectators step by step from the ripe apple to apple ju@@ ic@@ e.
Every now and th@@ en@@ , Hart@@ mann@@ -@@ Ni@@ emer@@ g had help from the children to fill the apples in the big fun@@ nel@@ .
With a little muscle power@@ , the apples became a finely ch@@ opped mass@@ .
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink was to be made from it@@ .
But they could even witness this important step on the late Friday afterno@@ on@@ .
Packed in mol@@ ds and wrapped in ne@@ ts@@ , Georg Hart@@ mann@@ -@@ Ni@@ emer@@ g st@@ acked the apple pieces layer by lay@@ er@@ , which looked a bit like ch@@ opped sh@@ red@@ s.
Thanks to certain technical sup@@ port@@ , the last work step was now no longer so difficul@@ t.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a big v@@ essel@@ .
But the Fü@@ cht@@ orf farmer also had bottled specialties with hi@@ m.
So he opened his “@@ treasure chest@@ ” and presented the latest Feder@@ wei@@ sser [@@ alcoholic be@@ ver@@ age@@ ] to the older visi@@ tor@@ s.
There was a lot of demand for the good “@@ Made in Fü@@ cht@@ or@@ f@@ ” be@@ ver@@ age@@ .
In a comfortable atmosp@@ here@@ , the parents got to talking while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing appl@@ es@@ , but also discovered the boun@@ cy castle that had been set up@@ .
Active members of the Fü@@ cht@@ orf com@@ ra@@ des@@ hip of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited people to join in fun games at several st@@ ations@@ .
The Home Association will also offer an action day next year@@ .
Th@@ en@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , emphasized Gregor Kr@@ ütz@@ kamp@@ , the community center in the heart of the as@@ parag@@ us village will not be the site of the ac@@ tion@@ .
In@@ stead@@ , a farmer will be visi@@ te@@ d.
That is also obvious because of the topic@@ : Bec@@ ause th@@ en@@ , it will all be about mil@@ k.




1@@ :@@ 4 against Frankfur@@ t@@ : Hannover facing fourth wash@@ out this season@@ : "@@ Sh@@ it@@ ty situ@@ ation@@ "
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row@@ , coach André Breiten@@ reiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , there were not many positives to take away from the bottom team@@ ’@@ s earlier 1@@ :@@ 4 (@@ 0@@ :@@ 2@@ ) result at Eintra@@ cht Frankfur@@ t.
It is a cra@@ ppy situ@@ ation@@ , but you have to come out on the other side as a team@@ , said 96 player Pir@@ min Sch@@ weg@@ ler@@ , ad@@ ding@@ : "@@ This is of course dis@@ appoin@@ ting@@ , because you always try for the best result possi@@ ble@@ "@@ .
Victory continues to el@@ ude the players from Lower Sax@@ ony@@ , for whom only Flor@@ ent Musli@@ ja (@@ 8@@ 6.@@ ) scored to narrow the g@@ ap@@ . They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and must be considered a releg@@ ation candidate in their current form@@ .
By contra@@ st@@ , an excellent An@@ te Re@@ bic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of the season@@ .
E@@ van Ob@@ ite N@@ di@@ cka in the 36@@ th minu@@ te@@ , Re@@ bic (@@ 45@@ th + 1@@ )@@ , Jonathan de Gu@@ z@@ mán (@@ 59@@ th@@ ) and Luka Jo@@ vic (@@ 89@@ th@@ ) scored for the DF@@ B Cup winners in front of 4@@ 6,@@ 300 spect@@ ator@@ s. After the successful dress rehear@@ sal for the Europa League match against La@@ zi@@ o@@ , Frankfurt move into the middle of the table on seven poin@@ ts@@ .
Croati@@ a@@ ’@@ s Vice World Champion Re@@ bic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move by the H@@ essi@@ ans at his starting eleven debut while Han@@ no@@ ver@@ ’@@ s defense struggled to reign him in@@ .
The stri@@ ker batter@@ ed after the World C@@ up@@ , showed by his tempo and asser@@ tiveness why he is so valuable for Eintra@@ cht@@ .
Be@@ sides Re@@ bi@@ c@@ , the Brazilian Al@@ lan@@ , on loan from Liverpool FC@@ , was called up to Frankfur@@ t@@ ’@@ s starting eleven for the first time and the team got off to a dynamic star@@ t.
The first sign of danger came in the form of Lucas Tor@@ ró@@ ’@@ s header (@@ 17@@ th@@ )@@ , which was deflec@@ ted into the ne@@ tt@@ ing@@ .
Six minutes later@@ , Sé@@ bas@@ tien H@@ aller was stopped by 96@@ ’@@ s defense in a promising position@@ . The defenders were led by the Brazilian Feli@@ pe@@ , in for Kevin W@@ immer@@ , who suffered a last@@ -@@ minute back in@@ jur@@ y@@ .
The home side@@ ’@@ s lead was all but inevitable and completely justi@@ fi@@ ed@@ .
After a defended corner ki@@ ck@@ , Fili@@ p Ko@@ stic lifted the ball into the box and H@@ aller headed it in front of the go@@ al@@ , where N@@ di@@ cka only had to tap it in@@ .
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team A@@ J Au@@ x@@ erre who had joined the club during the summer@@ .
And Frankfurt increased the t@@ ally before the break@@ .
This time@@ , H@@ aller passed to his fellow stri@@ ker Re@@ bi@@ c@@ , who skill@@ fully dri@@ b@@ bled through the lines leaving 96 go@@ al@@ keeper Michael E@@ sser no chan@@ ce@@ .
At half@@ -@@ time Hannover Coach Breiten@@ reiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hend@@ rik Wey@@ d@@ and@@ t@@ , two new attack@@ er@@ s.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the end of the match when they at least managed to score and narrow the g@@ ap@@ .
The H@@ essi@@ ans were much more effici@@ ent@@ .
After just under an hour Re@@ bic started a solo and then crossed to De Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án@@ , who just tapped the ball into the empty go@@ al@@ .
Pla@@ ying against over@@ stretched guest@@ s@@ , Frankfurt could take it easy for the rest of the mat@@ ch@@ , which also saw Jo@@ vic scoring with one minute to go@@ .

Gei@@ sin@@ gen@@ : Christians in Gei@@ singen celebrate the Holy Cross festival
Catholics in Gei@@ singen celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or on the Sunday after@@ .
The festival service takes place at the town chur@@ ch@@ , followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the bles@@ sin@@ g.
At the Church of the Holy Cross lies Christ@@ us@@ , who witnessed the Thir@@ ty Y@@ ear@@ s@@ ' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldi@@ er@@ .
Blood f@@ lowed from the gun@@ shot wo@@ und@@ .
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Christ@@ us@@ ' resting plac@@ e@@ , which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross@@ .
The construction is not finished y@@ et@@ , only the sanctuary is@@ , the missing na@@ ve is indicated by the tre@@ es@@ .
In his hom@@ il@@ y@@ , Father Adolf Bu@@ hl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope@@ , comfort and life@@ .
In@@ spite of the importance for the Gei@@ sing par@@ ish@@ , attendance was rather poor@@ .
After the service@@ , the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing concluded the ec@@ cle@@ sias@@ tical part of the cross festi@@ val@@ .
The Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home for many year@@ s.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a big selection of cakes and@@ , appropriate for the wea@@ ther@@ , farm@@ -@@ fresh ice cre@@ am@@ .
In the afterno@@ on@@ , the parish offered guided tours around the city chur@@ ch@@ , Bernd B@@ end@@ schnei@@ der and Petra Schmid@@ -@@ Se@@ ger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the fac@@ ade@@ , roo@@ f@@ , the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construc@@ tion@@ , which will last until next year@@ .
After the scaff@@ old has been standing for some time@@ , the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare more concre@@ tel@@ y@@ .
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than plan@@ ne@@ d@@ , because the already existing damage hase worsen@@ ded over the last few year@@ s@@ , but also more damaged has been un@@ cover@@ ed@@ , which was only possible through the inspection by means of the scaff@@ ol@@ d.
The pl@@ in@@ th pla@@ stering work is completed and before the winter@@ , the natural stone work will begin and the involved parties hope to finish about half of this work this year@@ .




Opening cerem@@ ony@@ : New residential home in Neu@@ -@@ Ul@@ m@@ ’@@ s Mün@@ ster@@ blick@@ straße
The Donau@@ -@@ I@@ ller life aid is opening a new hostel for people with disabilities in Mün@@ ster@@ blick@@ stra@@ ß@@ e.
All those attending the ceremony agreed that "@@ a very special house@@ " is now opening its doors for its intended purpos@@ e.
After all@@ , the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home provided by Lebens@@ hilfe Donau@@ -@@ I@@ ller for some time@@ , depend on its unique architec@@ ture@@ .
Wider a@@ isl@@ es@@ , hall@@ ways and door@@ s@@ , larger rooms and barri@@ er@@ -@@ free access for all areas have all been part of architect Rudolf Ba@@ der@@ ’@@ s concep@@ t.
Planning first began about eight years ago@@ , when the former US Army offic@@ ers@@ ’@@ building was tested for its suitability for residents with dis@@ abili@@ ti@@ es@@ : "@@ The house was getting old and no longer up@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ date in terms of feat@@ u@@ res@@ ,@@ " Ba@@ der explained looking back@@ .
In 201@@ 6@@ , excav@@ ators started rolling to demoli@@ sh the house@@ .
The new building was to be designed to be as welcoming and bright as possi@@ ble@@ , so that the residents could feel comfortable in it@@ , says the architec@@ t.
Lebens@@ hilfe Donau@@ -@@ I@@ ller opens new residential home
The life aid invested approximately 4.6 million euro in the new construc@@ tion@@ .
The state of Bavaria contributed 2.4 million Euro@@ s@@ , the district of Sw@@ ab@@ ia 45@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s.
According to architect Ba@@ der@@ , the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financi@@ all@@ y@@ .
The Lebens@@ hilfe@@ ’@@ s managing director Jürgen Heinz thanked Ba@@ der this accompli@@ sh@@ ment@@ .
The balance between a barri@@ er@@ -@@ free and fire@@ proof design has not always been easy@@ .
Never@@ thel@@ ess@@ , the planners and hand@@ y@@ men built a home with many specific@@ ations@@ , to allow residents the freedom to move even without outside hel@@ p.
The same was expressed by the head of social services in the Schw@@ aben di@@ stric@@ t@@ , Ger@@ tru@@ d Kre@@ ut@@ may@@ er@@ : ‘@@ The home is geared towards the special requirements of its re@@ sident@@ s@@ , who need help with mobili@@ ty@@ ’@@ .
Comfort and functionality have been combined to good effect in the process@@ , said Kre@@ ut@@ may@@ er@@ .
And al@@ so@@ : ‘@@ The property in this location is a real stroke of luck@@ , because it no longer needs to be acquired in to@@ day@@ ’@@ s situ@@ ation@@ ’@@ .
All in all@@ , the new residential home on Mün@@ ster@@ blick@@ strasse houses 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square me@@ ters@@ , divided into three residential group@@ s.
Lebens@@ hilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full@@ -@@ time employe@@ es@@ , all of whom are paid union wag@@ es@@ .




German@@ y@@ : Schwe@@ sig compla@@ ins about differences between East and West
Berlin - Pri@@ or to the anniversary of German uni@@ fic@@ ation@@ , the vic@@ e@@ -@@ president of the SP@@ D@@ , Manu@@ ela Schwe@@ si@@ g@@ , appealed to the nation not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East German@@ s.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity
We cannot permit ourselves to be satisfied with these differen@@ ces@@ ,@@ ” said the minister president of Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vorpommern to the “@@ Tages@@ spie@@ gel@@ ” on Sun@@ day@@ .
The goals must remain the sam@@ e@@ : to create equal living conditions across the country@@ .
It is unacceptable that East Germans work longer on average than people in Western German@@ y@@ , but receive 15 percent less sal@@ ary@@ .
This is in@@ explic@@ able@@ , nearly 30 years after the German Uni@@ fic@@ ation@@ , said Schwe@@ si@@ g.

In an effort to ease ties with Se@@ oul@@ , Py@@ ong@@ yang has given the South Korean President Moon Ja@@ e In two North Korean P@@ ungs@@ an ho@@ unds as a gi@@ ft@@ .
On Sun@@ day@@ , Mo@@ ons office announced that both do@@ gs@@ , about a year old reached the recipient already on Thurs@@ day@@ .
They passed through the Pan@@ mun@@ j@@ om border with three kilograms of dog food@@ , to help the animals ‘@@ to settle in@@ ’@@ .
The dogs with their thick@@ , white fur@@ , pointed ears and brown eyes are loyal and intelligent@@ .
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Pe@@ op@@ le@@ ’@@ s Democratic Republic of Kore@@ a.

A new week@@ , a new opportunity for the government
Back to regulatory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting to@@ day@@ .
Har@@ dly an inter@@ view@@ , hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CD@@ U@@ , SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke the man@@ tra "@@ return to work@@ "@@ .
That may have led some crafts@@ men@@ , doc@@ tor@@ s@@ , cas@@ hi@@ ers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference really is between work and paper@@ work@@ , but th@@ at@@ '@@ s all@@ .
Now the federal government is ready to devote itself again to the task of govern@@ ing@@ , they should not be distra@@ cted from this now with debates on termin@@ olo@@ gy@@ .
Whe@@ ther Union and SPD can pull off something together after the pro@@ voc@@ ations and dis@@ gra@@ ces of recent week@@ s@@ , will possibly be seen on Mon@@ day@@ .
The leaders of the governing parties will come together for the coalition committee in the even@@ ing@@ .
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to summ@@ on this session regul@@ ar@@ ly@@ , to def@@ use conflicts early on@@ ; lessons can be learned from all the disp@@ ut@@ es@@ .
First of all@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , conflic@@ t@@ -@@ laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retro@@ fits and the skilled labor immigration la@@ w.
CSU Transport Minister Sch@@ euer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to technically retro@@ fit older dies@@ els@@ .
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel cri@@ sis@@ , the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration la@@ w.
The SPD promotes a long@@ -@@ term perspective for failed asyl@@ um@@ -@@ seek@@ ers@@ , who work or who are tra@@ ining@@ .
The Union is strictly against the "@@ track change@@ " from the asylum system into the labor market@@ .
There will be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be other@@ wis@@ e@@ ?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand co@@ ali@@ tion@@ , but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and prioriti@@ es@@ .
Dispute is goo@@ d.
Without disp@@ u@@ te@@ , a subscribed society of such diver@@ se@@ , sometimes contradictory interests does not progre@@ ss@@ .
But to be construc@@ ti@@ ve@@ , dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of being or not@@ -@@ bein@@ g.
It is about politic@@ s@@ , not the@@ ater@@ .
Union and SPD are to argue - but must always have the reality of life of the people in vie@@ w.
What is possible and is of benefit to man@@ y@@ ?
With this key question@@ , both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmati@@ cally clarified - and confidence thereby reg@@ ain@@ ed@@ .
Ab@@ ove all@@ , that is what the pe@@ op@@ le@@ '@@ s parties must now fight for@@ .

A@@ mon@@ g other things Catalan security forces were attacked by pro@@ -@@ independence activists with colored pow@@ der@@ , as they were trying to prevent them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Gu@@ ard@@ s.

Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , some of the about 6000 separ@@ ati@@ sts tried to break the police chain by for@@ ce@@ , and were throwing at offici@@ als@@ , among other th@@ ings@@ , paint bombs and eg@@ gs@@ .

Foot@@ ball@@ : Ober@@ liga West@@ fal@@ en@@ : Complete helpl@@ ess@@ ness@@ : Go@@ all@@ ess match between FC Güter@@ slo@@ h and RW Ah@@ len
Rot@@ -@@ Weiß Ah@@ len still going no@@ where@@ .
FC Güter@@ slo@@ h only did@@ n@@ ’@@ t get further than a 0@@ -@@ 0 dra@@ w.
The tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated complete helpl@@ essness in front of 438 spectators at Heide@@ wald sta@@ di@@ um@@ .
The first half was rather dim in terms of enter@@ tain@@ ment@@ .
Any@@ one who wanted to go get a beer or br@@ at@@ wurst could do it without worrying they would miss any@@ th@@ ing@@ .
There was no risk of missing a goal opportun@@ ity@@ , because there were virtually non@@ e.
The first shot on goal happened after half an hour@@ .
Respon@@ sible for the first (@@ harm@@ less@@ ) shot on goal was Güter@@ slo@@ h@@ ’@@ s Nick F@@ lock in minute 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the team from Ah@@ len@@ , when F@@ CG go@@ al@@ keeper Freder@@ ic Wester@@ ger@@ ling saved C@@ ih@@ an Y@@ il@@ ma@@ z@@ ’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 3@@ 2.
The hosts were even more harm@@ less@@ .
Thei@@ r most effective action was an early sub@@ stitution@@ .
Stri@@ ker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to in@@ jur@@ y@@ . Sin@@ an Ay@@ gü@@ n replaced hi@@ m.
After the sub@@ stitution@@ , both teams decided to do something against the growing bore@@ dom@@ .
In minute 48@@ , Sebastian M@@ ütz@@ el shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after one hour the Güter@@ slo@@ h player also appeared offensive for the very first time@@ .
After a ball recap@@ ture by Matth@@ äus Wi@@ ec@@ ko@@ wi@@ cz@@ , this was quickly dealt with@@ .
Nick F@@ lock (@@ minute 6@@ 2@@ ) "@@ crow@@ ne@@ d@@ " the quick counter@@ attack over Sin@@ an Ay@@ gü@@ n with a lax shot into the arms of RWA go@@ al@@ keeper Bernd Schi@@ p@@ mann@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , they went one better with a header from Wi@@ ec@@ ko@@ wicz (@@ minute 66@@ ) after a corner from former Ah@@ len player Tim Man@@ stein@@ .
RWA interim coach Angelo D@@ aut respon@@ de@@ d@@ , sub@@ stituting Martin Fu@@ h@@ sy for Marko O@@ nu@@ cka (@@ minute 60@@ ) and a little later Sebastian M@@ ütz@@ el for En@@ es Gü@@ ney (@@ minute 70@@ )@@ .
That lead to no@@ th@@ ing@@ .
The team from Ah@@ len did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initi@@ ati@@ ve@@ .
Only in the 9@@ 1st minute did C@@ ih@@ an Y@@ il@@ ma@@ z have the last chan@@ ce@@ , but that did not get them any@@ where@@ .
Angelo D@@ aut tried to emphasize the positive after@@ war@@ ds@@ : "@@ I like that we kept a clean she@@ et@@ .@@ " But un@@ fortun@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ , both sides scored zer@@ o.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as against Holz@@ wick@@ ede@@ , even though our opponents did not want to play here@@ , states RW Ah@@ len@@ ’@@ s interim co@@ ach@@ .
Offen@@ si@@ vel@@ y@@ , "@@ everything just happened someh@@ ow@@ " against a team that "@@ just wanted to def@@ end@@ .

Graffiti with a local political mes@@ sage@@ : Un@@ successful advertising for a sk@@ ate park
In L@@ eng@@ eri@@ ch@@ , unknown people have advocated for the construction of a sk@@ ate park in a hardly beneficial way@@ .
In several plac@@ es@@ , there are gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ , says Jürgen K@@ ohne of the city administration on the request of the W@@ N.
In at least one cas@@ e@@ , a criminal complaint for property damage has been filed with the poli@@ ce@@ .
The three words "@@ Sk@@ ate@@ park for L@@ eng@@ eri@@ ch@@ !@@ " are displayed in large letters on sign@@ s@@ , among others at the G@@ emp@@ t@@ -@@ Halle and the Old Town Hall@@ .
Michael Rot@@ t@@ mann@@ , manager of the hall@@ , reports that writing was found on the advertising sign on the staircase to the G@@ empt Bistro on September 19 after the career choice fair@@ .
Since the short message was apparently "@@ on@@ ly@@ " made with a mark@@ er@@ , it could easily be remo@@ ved@@ .
A few days later@@ , it was there aga@@ in@@ , but this time it was spra@@ yed on@@ , says Rot@@ t@@ mann@@ .
He assumes that the respective advertising sign has to be replac@@ ed@@ .
This case is special by the fact that several large companies from Len@@ ger@@ ich are mentioned on the board@@ .
If the sk@@ ate park is buil@@ t@@ , its realization will also be made possible by sponsor@@ s.
There are already ple@@ d@@ ges@@ , explains Jörg H@@ essel@@ mann from the urban department of school@@ s@@ , sports and cul@@ ture@@ , without naming nam@@ es@@ .
It is possi@@ ble@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ed board@@ .
For year@@ s@@ , local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of a sk@@ ate park@@ .
After the old had been dismantled at the L@@ W@@ L clini@@ c@@ , the search for an alternative location began@@ .
The council finally chose the fire department parking lot@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , this request was not implemented - appar@@ ent@@ ly@@ , too many factors were against a construction at this poin@@ t.
At the end of Jun@@ e@@ , it was all turned around aga@@ in@@ .
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gut@@ enberg school@@ .
Re@@ gar@@ ding the state of aff@@ air@@ s@@ , Jürgen K@@ ohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete plann@@ ing@@ .
Th@@ en@@ , city council has the last wor@@ d.
He assumes a decision will be reached this year@@ , so that park can be built in 20@@ 19.




Bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks in air traffic control are getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffic in the summer@@ , German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year@@ .
This year it was only wind@@ , 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit after th@@ at@@ , head of the German air traffic uni@@ on@@ , Matthias Ma@@ as@@ , told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Ham@@ bur@@ g.
He said that the well known staff shortages pla@@ guing European air traffic controllers are an important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix to this proble@@ m.
Airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year@@ , but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five year@@ s@@ , the uni@@ onist sa@@ i@@ d.
He added that there are hardly any fully trained air traffic controllers available on the European market@@ .
He pointed out that the Karlsruhe center monitoring German@@ y@@ ’@@ s upper air space alone is short of some one hundred staff@@ .
Maas again criticized the fact that different air transport trade unions were not invited to the summ@@ it@@ .
Representatives from federal and state govern@@ ments@@ , air traffic controll@@ ers@@ , the air@@ lin@@ es@@ , and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the del@@ ay@@ s.
If you want to talk about additional work and over@@ time@@ , that will not work without us@@ , said the head of the German air traffic uni@@ on@@ , many members of which work for the feder@@ ally owned German air traffic control company DF@@ S.
Maas again held the EU Commission@@ ’@@ s guidelines responsible for the air traffic control predi@@ ca@@ ment@@ .
He asserted that traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 had been far too low@@ .
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services now have a severe impact on daily oper@@ ations@@ , he stre@@ sse@@ d.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Sch@@ euer (@@ CS@@ U@@ )@@ , to promote regulations in Brussels that would not "@@ keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxy@@ gen@@ "@@ .
He cau@@ tioned th@@ at@@ , as things stand@@ , the EU targets would be coordinated by 20@@ 24 and further tightening is to be expec@@ te@@ d.
According to Ma@@ as@@ , the EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure from the air@@ lin@@ es@@ .
Ryanair bo@@ ss@@ , Michael O@@ '@@ Le@@ ary and his colleagues have now re@@ ap@@ ed exactly what they have so@@ wn in recent year@@ s@@ , said Ma@@ as@@ .
He hopes that the high costs incurred by the airlines as a result of delays will lead them to think aga@@ in@@ .
The German air traffic union would work to improve the situation only if the D@@ FS were to offer a "@@ coherent agreement for fut@@ ure@@ -@@ oriented training and educ@@ ation@@ ,@@ " said Ma@@ as@@ .
He further noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age@@ -@@ related personnel reduc@@ tions@@ .
It does not yet address the necessary staff expan@@ sion@@ .




Thyssen@@ k@@ rup@@ p supervisory board votes for group restructuring
The members of the Thyssen@@ k@@ rup@@ p Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the plans for the reorganization of the Grou@@ p.
According to the wishes of Thyssen@@ k@@ rup@@ p interim head@@ , Guido Kerk@@ hoff@@ , who was appointed to the meeting on Sunday for the management board@@ , the cri@@ sis@@ -@@ hit group will be split into two independent compani@@ es@@ .
Bot@@ h companies will have their registered office in Essen and will be listed on the stock ex@@ change@@ .

Barcelon@@ a@@ : Police brutality and violent Catalan independence activists at demonstr@@ ations@@ .
Viol@@ ent clashes by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona with numerous casualties at two concur@@ rent demonstr@@ ations@@ .
According to the city administr@@ ation@@ , about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Satur@@ day@@ , as about 6000 independence activists demonstr@@ at@@ ed@@ .
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protesting groups away from each other@@ .
According to deployment for@@ ces@@ , advocates for independence again tried to break through the security barri@@ er@@ .
They attacked the officers with paint and thrown objec@@ ts@@ .
Bra@@ wls between the participants of the two protesting groups were also re@@ porte@@ d.
24 people were injured according to the rescue for@@ ces@@ .
The police stated there have been six ar@@ rest@@ s.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central govern@@ ment@@ .
They demanded better salaries at the same time@@ .
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much more than they wer@@ e.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all plac@@ es@@ .
Why did they come here to prote@@ st@@ ? The 55@@ -@@ year old Catalan demonstr@@ ator Man@@ el Per@@ ez asked the news agency AF@@ P.
Simp@@ ly to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year ag@@ o.
A 31@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old policeman from the Balearic Is@@ lands@@ , who said his name is Daniel@@ , rejected the accus@@ ation@@ .
Of course we want to support our com@@ rades who were only doing their job a year ago@@ : defending the law@@ , he sa@@ i@@ d.
But the demonstration is here to enforce our rights and we@@ '@@ re doing it in Barcelon@@ a@@ , because it is a major European city and there is more echo here@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , he and his colleagues did “@@ not come here to provo@@ ke@@ ,@@ ” the policeman ensured us@@ .

Foot@@ ball@@ : Ju@@ vent@@ us trainer applau@@ ds the top g@@ ame@@ : Ron@@ al@@ do@@ ’@@ s best game
The Portuguese star stri@@ ker ‘@@ this evening played the best game in addition to Valenci@@ a@@ ’@@ s half hour@@ ’@@ , commended Ju@@ vent@@ us coach Massi@@ mili@@ ano Alle@@ gri after the 3@@ :@@ 1 (@@ 1@@ :@@ 1@@ ) victory of the record champion against SSC Napoli@@ .
For the co@@ ach@@ , the exp@@ en@@ sively purchased star without scoring himself was the decisive man of the match in the important game against the pursu@@ er@@ s.
Ron@@ aldo had a lot of fun and did it well@@ , said Al@@ leg@@ ri@@ .
Even if we started with tactical er@@ ror@@ s@@ , Ron@@ aldo was very good with our first goal and we just got better from then on@@ ward@@ s.
Thanks to Ron@@ al@@ do@@ ’@@ s three assi@@ st@@ s@@ , Ju@@ ve struck back in the game after being down early through the goal by D@@ ries Mer@@ tens (@@ 10th Minu@@ te@@ ) and in the thick of things the pursu@@ er was put off for the time bein@@ g.
The go@@ al@@ -@@ get@@ ter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mand@@ zu@@ k@@ ic@@ , who provided a double score (@@ 26.@@ /@@ 49.@@ ) for the le@@ ad@@ .
And Ron@@ aldo provided the buil@@ d@@ -@@ up with a head ball from a corner sh@@ ot@@ , for the goal by the defence leader Leonardo Bon@@ u@@ cci (@@ 76@@ )@@ , who just had to make a short push in@@ , in front of the goal line@@ .
He gives a lot@@ , said the tra@@ iner@@ .
But naturally Alle@@ gri will also see goals from the attack@@ er@@ , who is the record goal sc@@ orer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team@@ .
We have to get better at serving him@@ , the coach sa@@ i@@ d.
Cur@@ rently Mand@@ zu@@ k@@ ic is the best Ju@@ ve sc@@ orer with four goals - Ron@@ aldo has thre@@ e.
The superiority of Ju@@ vent@@ us seems even more overwhel@@ ming@@ , with the purchase of Ron@@ al@@ do@@ , for more than 100 million Euro@@ s.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Series A. With 21 points the masters over the past seven years already have a six@@ -@@ point lead over Napoli@@ .
The second team in the table@@ , co@@ ached by the former Bayer coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti@@ , was not without chances against Tur@@ in@@ .
The top match was however decided at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Ru@@ i (@@ 5@@ 8.@@ )@@ .
The Portuguese after a too strong pile in against Paulo Dy@@ bal@@ a had to leave the field with a yel@@ low@@ -@@ re@@ d.
We played well against a good Napoli@@ , the Turin coach commen@@ te@@ d.
Em@@ re Can should also feel addre@@ sse@@ d.
The German national has asserted himself at Ju@@ ve@@ .
The profession@@ al@@ , who came from Liver@@ pool@@ , participated in all seven league mat@@ ch@@ es@@ .
The mid@@ fiel@@ der also played in the Champions League game against Valenci@@ a@@ , which is what Alle@@ gri meant by the ‘@@ half hour@@ ’@@ : Ron@@ aldo was sent off at the 2@@ :@@ 0 Turin win and is barred for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern@@ .

He needed exactly two touches in this game for this go@@ al@@ .

On the home field of releg@@ ated club@@ ’@@ s VC All@@ bau Essen@@ , the blue@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ white won with 3@@ -@@ 1.
It was a huge step in a cool season@@ .
It@@ ’@@ s so much fun to play in the upper third of the le@@ ag@@ ue@@ .
This is what we have been working to@@ war@@ ds@@ , says trainer Dominik Mün@@ ch exc@@ it@@ edly after an almost flawless performance by his team at the now defeated table lea@@ der@@ .
In the first part@@ , the guests dominated almost however they wan@@ te@@ d.
With 4@@ -@@ 1@@ , 16@@ -10 and 22@@ -@@ 12@@ , the run@@ ner@@ -@@ up of the previous year won with a 25@@ -@@ 15.
Essen played with two lin@@ es@@ , but has not come into play@@ .
We kept them on their to@@ es@@ .
Our opponent struck with a high risk@@ , but also produced countless penalty card@@ s.
In the second set@@ , the B@@ SV already led with 12@@ -@@ 8. "@@ Essen changed to three lin@@ es@@ .
We could not hold the pres@@ su@@ re@@ .
Essen moved in clo@@ ser@@ , and we let ourselves be l@@ ul@@ led a bit@@ ,@@ " Mün@@ ch continu@@ ed@@ .

Although Ost@@ be@@ vern defended four set balls at 19@@ :@@ 24@@ , the fifth attempt found its tar@@ get@@ .
The game was now in a better class@@ , believes the trainer about the perform@@ anc@@ e.
Mai@@ ke Rü@@ ding@@ loh and then Wieb@@ ke Sil@@ ge made huge contributions with their serves that B@@ SV turned the page in the third set from 14@@ :@@ 16 to 25@@ :@@ 21.
Mün@@ ch@@ : "@@ We played consistently and cal@@ m@@ ly@@ .@@ "
At 7@@ -@@ 3 and 15@@ -@@ 13@@ , the blue@@ -@@ white added part four with 25@@ :@@ 22 to their side@@ .

Internation@@ al@@ : Turkish commun@@ ity@@ : Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (@@ T@@ G@@ D@@ ) has criticized the way the great Di@@ ti@@ b Mosque was opened in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan@@ .
The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of sh@@ ards in the German@@ -@@ Turkish relation@@ ship@@ , which can be put together only with difficul@@ ty@@ , said the chairman of the T@@ G@@ D@@ , Gö@@ kay So@@ fu@@ o@@ glu@@ , to the editorial network German@@ y@@ .

Nott@@ ul@@ n Home Associ@@ ation@@ : The offer has already been established
It@@ ’@@ s Folk Festival time again finally after the long summer break
On October 18th (@@ Thurs@@ day@@ ) at 19@@ :@@ 30@@ , the Heimat@@ verein Nott@@ ul@@ n already hosts his fifth Nott@@ ul@@ ner Fol@@ k@@ tre@@ ff in the fireplace room of the old Amt@@ man@@ nei@@ .
It@@ ’@@ s almost exactly a year to the day since we met here for a Folk Festival for the first time@@ .
This event has now become a fix@@ ture in the musical event calendar in Nott@@ ul@@ n@@ ,@@ ” says Hann@@ s Moor@@ mann@@ , chairman of the Nott@@ ul@@ n Home Associ@@ ation@@ , pleas@@ ed@@ .
I would not have thought that our Fol@@ k@@ tre@@ ff got established so quickly in Nott@@ ul@@ n.
Whe@@ ther it was the storm Frie@@ deri@@ ke in January or the heat wave in J@@ ul@@ y@@ , the fireplace room of the ‘@@ Amt@@ man@@ nei@@ ’ was always ful@@ l.
As al@@ wa@@ ys@@ , the program for the next Folk Festival is a colorful mix of German fol@@ k@@ , hiking and sail@@ or son@@ gs@@ , ever@@ greens an old hit@@ s@@ , says Karl@@ -@@ Heinz Ste@@ ver@@ mü@@ er@@ , who is always inviting musical friends to Nott@@ ul@@ n.
Klaus Sp@@ ell@@ meyer has promised to play his acc@@ or@@ dion for the first Folk Festival “@@ birth@@ day@@ .@@ ”
He was a member of “@@ Ga@@ it@@ ling@@ ” many years ago@@ , a group from the neighboring district of Stein@@ fur@@ t@@ , which played music with Low German ly@@ ric@@ s.
Now he@@ '@@ s a member of an Irish folk band@@ .
The creators of the Folk Festival fon@@ dly remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schul@@ tz from the Folk Festival Em@@ s@@ de@@ tten excited the audience with his international version of the song “@@ Fro@@ gs in the Night@@ ” and sent them home with the song stuck in their head@@ s.
We are expecting many happy guests to spend another soci@@ able and humor@@ ous evening toge@@ ther@@ , says the invitation from the Home Associ@@ ation@@ .
Any@@ one who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join in@@ .
Since the coveted seats are always taken quick@@ ly@@ , it@@ ’@@ s recommended to get there early en@@ ou@@ gh@@ .
The Folk Festival will start at 7@@ :@@ 30 p@@ m@@ , but admission begins at 7 p@@ m.




China approves planned merger of Linde and Pra@@ x@@ air
For legal reasons all open questions must be clarified by October 24.
Frankfurt Linde and Pra@@ x@@ air are one step further to becoming the world@@ ’@@ s largest industrial gases comp@@ any@@ .
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned mer@@ ger@@ , Linde said on Sun@@ day@@ .
This means that only the authorisations from South Korea and - as the biggest hur@@ dle - in the USA are still outstanding for the multi@@ -@@ billion dollar mer@@ ger@@ .
The chances of the approval of an insider has improved recently as a resul@@ t@@ , because Linde has confirmed the sale of additional company par@@ ts@@ .

From clean fruit to ecology
The 12@@ 5th anniversary of the District Association for Gar@@ dening and Landscape Conservation was celebrated with a gala at the Dr.@@ -@@ Stamm@@ ber@@ ger@@ -@@ H@@ alle@@ .
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kul@@ mb@@ ach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreis@@ verband für Garten@@ bau und Landes@@ pflege Kul@@ mb@@ ach (@@ District Association for Gar@@ dening and Landscape Conservation Kul@@ mb@@ ach@@ )@@ , and exactly 125 years later@@ , on Saturday night@@ , the association celebrated the big anniversary in the Kul@@ mb@@ ach Stad@@ thalle (@@ civic cent@@ re@@ )@@ .
Frank@@ ly the association had a different name at that time@@ : In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Fl@@ essa am@@ moun@@ ced the name as "@@ Bezir@@ k@@ so@@ b@@ st@@ bau@@ verein Kul@@ mb@@ ach Stadt und Land@@ " (@@ District Fruit Gro@@ wing Association Kul@@ mb@@ ach City and Country@@ )@@ .
The purpose of the fruit@@ -@@ growing association differ@@ ed from that of to@@ day@@ ’@@ s work - in fac@@ t@@ , it was purely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time@@ .
At that time@@ , in the era of the Enligh@@ ten@@ ment@@ , the fruit tree was a favorite child of the eli@@ te@@ , explained the local history curator Günter Di@@ p@@ pold in his spe@@ ech@@ .
Fruit trees lined the high@@ wa@@ ys@@ , so@@ -@@ called industrial gardens were created at school@@ s.
Today fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kul@@ mb@@ ach@@ , which include almost 7 000 member@@ s.
But by far that is not the end of the scop@@ e.
Gar@@ dening close to nat@@ ure@@ , biological crop protection@@ , village beauti@@ fication and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge about healthy diets and youth work@@ .
The members of the Hut@@ sch@@ dorf youth group "@@ Maul@@ wür@@ fe@@ " (@@ mol@@ es@@ ) showed enter@@ tain@@ ingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are@@ .
Youth work is critically import@@ ant@@ , especially in the digital age@@ , said Günter Rei@@ f@@ , chairman of the district coun@@ cil@@ , and the lord mayor Henry Sch@@ ra@@ mm also emphasised how important experiences in nature are for life@@ .
Collec@@ ting chest@@ nuts was for us as children a huge th@@ ing@@ , I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy@@ .
Sch@@ ra@@ mm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner .
Where the trees will be planted will be decided by the district associ@@ ation@@ , added district administrator S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner and emphasised the special importance of the gardening associations for the vil@@ la@@ ges@@ .
The district association stands for ec@@ olo@@ gy@@ , the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the vil@@ lage@@ .
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the di@@ stric@@ t@@ , was also stated without doubt by the county manager and consultant Fried@@ helm Ha@@ un@@ .
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about the long history of the district association and reported among other th@@ ings@@ , how necessary self@@ -@@ sufficiency was after the war@@ .
In the old days everything came from the gar@@ den@@ , for the winter con@@ serves were ma@@ de@@ .
At the end of the 50@@ s@@ , the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live@@ -in gar@@ den@@ .
Nature endu@@ res@@ , it existed before us and we must adapt ourselves to it@@ , ple@@ aded the specialist in fruit and nut tre@@ es@@ .
There is an incentive therefore for the gardening associations not to give up@@ , so that our country remains beautiful and worth liv@@ ing@@ .
Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associ@@ ations@@ , explained the President of the Bavarian Associ@@ ation@@ , Wol@@ fram Va@@ it@@ l.
We must stop the blatant decline in insec@@ ts@@ , we owe it to our children and grand@@ chil@@ dren@@ , Günter Rei@@ f concluded the successful cerem@@ ony@@ , which was festi@@ vely framed by the tower brass musicians of the Thur@@ nau music associ@@ ation@@ .

Can@@ ada@@ ’@@ s foreign minister is now giving trading agreements absolute priority - and is delaying her speech for the United N@@ ations@@ .
Due to the time pressure involved in the struggle for a new edition of the North American free trade agreement (@@ N@@ af@@ ta@@ ) with the USA and Mexi@@ co@@ , the Canadian foreign minister Chr@@ y@@ stia Fre@@ eland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New Yor@@ k.
In@@ stead of to@@ day@@ , Satur@@ day@@ , the minister will not speak before the United Nations general assembly until Mon@@ day@@ , shared her spokesperson Adam Au@@ sten@@ .
In the meantime she will concentrate on the renegoti@@ ation of N@@ af@@ ta@@ .
On Friday the Mexican Economy Minister Il@@ def@@ onso Gu@@ aj@@ ardo explained that Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been made between his country and the US@@ A.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed on a new version of the regional N@@ af@@ ta free trade agre@@ e@@ ment@@ .

Pro@@ tests against presidential candidate Bol@@ son@@ aro
Brazilian presidential candidate J@@ air Bol@@ son@@ aro@@ , who was injured in a knife attack@@ , has been released from the hosp@@ ital@@ .
According to a report in the daily newspaper "@@ O Glo@@ bo@@ "@@ , the far@@ -@@ right ex@@ -@@ military wanted to fly to his hometown Río de Jan@@ ei@@ ro@@ .
After his rele@@ ase@@ , it is still unclear whether the 63@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old will attend any events in the last week before the presidential elec@@ tions@@ .
The politician had been attacked on the street in early September during an election campaign in southern Bra@@ z@@ il@@ .
Me@@ an@@ whi@@ le@@ , in several Brazilian ci@@ ti@@ es@@ , thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bol@@ son@@ aro@@ .
Under the title "@@ E@@ le n@@ ã@@ o@@ " (@@ Engli@@ sh@@ : "@@ Not him@@ "@@ )@@ , especially wom@@ en@@ '@@ s associations protested against the ex@@ -@@ militar@@ y@@ .
The associations also took to social media to protest against Bol@@ son@@ aro@@ '@@ s racist and mis@@ og@@ yn@@ ist state@@ ments@@ .
Sever@@ al thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic hub São Pau@@ lo@@ .
In the capital of Brasi@@ lia@@ , protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Wor@@ ker@@ s@@ ’ Party (@@ PT@@ )@@ , Fernando Had@@ da@@ d.
He took the position of former president In@@ á@@ cio Lula da Sil@@ va@@ , who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presiden@@ cy@@ .
The presidential election in Brazil will be on October 7.
As the former mayor of the meg@@ acity of São Pau@@ lo@@ , Had@@ dad has so far been behind the extreme right candidate Bol@@ son@@ aro according to poll@@ s.
The “@@ Trump of Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ” has been in politics for a long time@@ , but only recently has presented himself as an anti@@ -@@ system candi@@ date@@ .
If none of the candidates reach absolute majority in the first round@@ , there will be a run@@ off election on October 28@@ th@@ .
Experts assume that Bol@@ son@@ aro will not be victorious - no matter who he is up aga@@ inst@@ .
Bol@@ son@@ aro is known for being against gay and black people and for glori@@ fying the military dictatorship (@@ 196@@ 4@@ -@@ 198@@ 5@@ )@@ .
He shocks the people of Brazil with verbal der@@ ail@@ ments over and over aga@@ in@@ .
Once he said that the supporters of Lu@@ la@@ '@@ s le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing Labor Party should be shot dead@@ .

Fol@@ lowing a long ill@@ ness@@ : Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Lar@@ sen is dead@@ .
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 following a long ill@@ ness@@ , shared his producer Jör@@ n J@@ ep@@ p@@ esen on Lar@@ sen@@ ’@@ s web@@ site@@ .
Lar@@ sen was surrounded on his de@@ ath@@ bed by his wife and six chil@@ dren@@ .
Since the beginning of the year the musician had been under treatment for pro@@ state can@@ cer@@ .
Lar@@ sen became famous with the band Gas@@ ol@@ in@@ '@@ , which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandin@@ avi@@ a.
Thei@@ r songs were influenced by music gre@@ ats such as Jim@@ i Hend@@ ri@@ x@@ , Bob Dylan and the Beat@@ les@@ .
In 197@@ 8@@ , after the dissolution of the band@@ , Lar@@ sen was successful as a solo arti@@ st@@ .
He sold about three million records in Den@@ mark@@ .
His album "@@ Mi@@ dt om nat@@ ten@@ " from 1983 is still the best@@ -@@ selling album in Den@@ mark@@ .
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lö@@ kke Rasmussen paid tribute to Lar@@ sen on Sunday as a "@@ street boy@@ " who was "@@ against every@@ th@@ ing@@ , but in every@@ one@@ ’@@ s hear@@ ts@@ .@@ "
The head of government also recalled that in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Lar@@ sen performed on the occasion of the 70@@ th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.




A night of rock in the shoe fac@@ tor@@ y@@ : Lou@@ d as a jack@@ hammer
Here we stand@@ , taking the bone saw and ign@@ iting a concert evening with the strength of a ti@@ ger@@ . The band names Here We Stand@@ , Tiger Bon@@ es@@ aw and The I@@ gnition alone suggest such a description of the ro@@ cking live music event on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürger@@ zentrum Schuh@@ fabri@@ k@@ , the community center housed in an old shoe fac@@ tor@@ y@@ : Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who are also friend@@ s.
After the sound@@ check and shortly before the start of the concer@@ t@@ , the musicians take time for a group phot@@ o.
There is no hint of stage fri@@ ght in the process@@ .
After@@ war@@ ds@@ , the lead singers and their bands from Ah@@ len and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mos@@ quito booking agency from O@@ el@@ de - visibly enth@@ r@@ all the approximately 120 visitors of the M@@ int Mos@@ quito rock night with their loud perform@@ anc@@ es@@ .
Ki@@ cking things off@@ , the Tiger Bon@@ es@@ aw quartet around front@@ man and guitarist Dennis Had@@ rika manages to win the crowd with their lat@@ est@@ , unknown piec@@ es@@ , which the band p@@ enn@@ ed themselves for their soon to be released CD@@ .
In front of the sta@@ ge@@ , people dance to the powerful yet harmonious band perform@@ anc@@ e.
Des@@ p@@ ite loud calls for an enco@@ re@@ , Tiger Bon@@ es@@ aw then hand over the reign@@ s to the thre@@ e@@ -@@ member Here We Stand@@ .
Gu@@ itar@@ ist Sa@@ scha Bregen@@ hor@@ n@@ , Gol@@ o Mei@@ erh@@ enrich on bass@@ , and drummer Kai Höl@@ scher demonstrate the variety within hard rock with their alternative sound@@ , which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock@@ .
Fol@@ lowing the high energy rock of the Ti@@ ger@@ s@@ , Here We Stand adds a syn@@ thesizer on top of the guitar sound@@ .
A@@ mon@@ g other tit@@ les@@ , the year@@ ning@@ , almost bal@@ lad@@ -@@ like Take Me Home captiv@@ ates the audience by switching between melodic passages and the guitar@@ -@@ heavy rock reefs typical of the multi@@ -@@ layered son@@ gs@@ .
Me@@ an@@ whi@@ le@@ , the quartet The I@@ gnition from T@@ ön@@ nis@@ häu@@ schen have earned a special reputation since the band formed in 200@@ 5.
The band presented their full@@ -@@ energy hard rock on Satur@@ day@@ .
It is obvious and unmistakable that The I@@ gnition have a great deal of stage experience from their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Mei@@ s about the 2017 China tour@@ .
Pla@@ ying off his band@@ , Singer and guitarist Tim Jung@@ mann has his very own take on the even@@ ing@@ ’@@ s only cover - Word Up by Cam@@ eo from the 80@@ s.
Me@@ an@@ whi@@ le@@ , it feels like the volume is di@@ aled up even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brink@@ mann delivers a solo while running through the che@@ ering crow@@ d.
Of cour@@ se@@ , when it comes to hard rock concer@@ ts@@ , a certain deci@@ bel level has to be expec@@ ted@@ : According to the sound crew@@ , that level was around 98 deci@@ bels for the three band concert with Here We Stand@@ , Tiger Bon@@ es@@ aw@@ , and The I@@ gnition during the M@@ int Mos@@ quito night of rock@@ .
That is approximately the same level as a jack@@ hammer@@ , which is still significantly lower than the peak volumes at W@@ acken Open Air festival referenced on the band website of The I@@ gni@@ tion@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the Ah@@ len audience has no need during this night of rock for 120 deci@@ bel sound as loud as a jet engine@@ , as is common at the heavy metal get together in the north of German@@ y@@ .
After just under four ho@@ urs@@ , the three hard rock bands have long since won the audience over with their confi@@ dent@@ , expert performance and own son@@ gs@@ .
In the end@@ , all three bands can honest@@ ly@@ , if figur@@ ati@@ vel@@ y@@ , say@@ : "@@ Here we stand@@ , having taken the bone saw and ign@@ ited a concert evening with the strength of a ti@@ ger@@ .@@ "
Ab@@ ove all@@ , they enjoyed the plentiful applause from the au@@ dien@@ ce@@ .

Close to Mül@@ heim@@ /@@ Essen airport a fatal accident occurred on Sun@@ day@@ .
As reported by the ‘@@ West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeit@@ ung@@ ’@@ , a gli@@ der crashed into the parking lot at the air@@ port@@ .

Trump adores Kim@@ : "@@ And then we fell in lo@@ ve@@ "
It is no secret that the US President is well disposed towards North Kore@@ a@@ ’@@ s ruler Kim@@ , despite the nuclear cri@@ si@@ s.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleag@@ ue@@ .
This is also linked to Kim@@ ’@@ s ‘@@ wonderful let@@ ters@@ ’@@ .
At the tender age of 72 year@@ s@@ , the married US president has a new fl@@ ame@@ .
The tragic thing is@@ : It is a long@@ -@@ distance relation@@ ship@@ .
On Satur@@ day@@ , in total public@@ , Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un@@ .
Sup@@ porters in the US federal state of West Virginia have heard tender words from Trump for the desc@@ endant from the ruling dynasty of Py@@ ong@@ yang half his age@@ , although the struggle for North Kore@@ a@@ ’@@ s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a particularly tough job@@ .
I was tough and so was he@@ , it went backwards and forwards between us@@ , reported Tru@@ mp@@ .
Then we fell in lo@@ ve@@ .
OK@@ ?
No@@ , re@@ all@@ y@@ .
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to mel@@ t.
He wrote me beautiful let@@ ters@@ , they were great let@@ ters@@ .
Thei@@ r personal connection also bore fruit politic@@ all@@ y@@ : Trump pointed to Kim@@ ’@@ s announced to halt all nuclear and missile test@@ s@@ , even though critics say it is mere cheap tal@@ k.
The US president seemed to be fully a@@ ware@@ , that not everyone was fond of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "@@ Ro@@ cket Man@@ " - so Tru@@ mp@@ ’@@ s nickname for Kim@@ .
He accepted the expected criticism during his appearance at a large sports hall in the city of Whe@@ el@@ ing@@ : ‘@@ Donald Trump sa@@ ys@@ , they have fallen in lo@@ ve@@ ’@@ .
How terri@@ ble@@ , how terrible is th@@ is@@ ?
That is so un@@ presiden@@ ti@@ al@@ .
He cared little for th@@ at@@ , said Tru@@ mp@@ , pointing his finger at the crow@@ d@@ : "@@ I always told you@@ , it is so easy to be presiden@@ ti@@ al.@@ "
But 10,000 people outside would not be sur@@ ging into this packed ar@@ en@@ a@@ , we would only have 200 people standing out@@ side@@ .

Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya which has made it possible for them to be rescu@@ ed@@ .
At the risk of their li@@ ves@@ , the group had shot the video in their cell in the coastal town of Sa@@ wi@@ ja in July and spread it on@@ line@@ .
They refuse to send us back@@ , said a man in the video mes@@ sage@@ .
We are suffering here@@ . We are dying here@@ .
The recording was sent to the website “@@ France 24 Ob@@ ser@@ vers@@ ,@@ ” whose editors aler@@ ted the International Organization for Migration (@@ I@@ OM@@ )@@ .
The refugees were ultimately flown out to Nigeria at the end of August@@ .
Without the video@@ , we likely would not have been able to return to Nigeri@@ a@@ , said E@@ fe Ony@@ ek@@ a@@ , who made the video@@ , according to the news agency AF@@ P.
The 25@@ -@@ year old was arrested in Libya when attempting to make her way into Europe via the Mediterran@@ e@@ an@@ .
With the video@@ , he said he ris@@ ked his own life@@ .
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by guar@@ ds@@ , said Ony@@ ek@@ a.
In gener@@ al@@ , the conditions in jail were catastro@@ phi@@ c@@ ; “@@ They beat all of us with pipes and sti@@ ck@@ s.@@ ”
They did@@ n@@ '@@ t give us anything to eat@@ . We had to drink out of the lat@@ rin@@ e.
The I@@ OM organized the voluntary repatriation of the refugees who were stranded in Liby@@ a.
About 2,@@ 700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home in the West African country this year with the help of the program@@ , said the I@@ OM spokesperson Jorge Gal@@ in@@ do@@ .
Gi@@ ven the poor conditions in Liby@@ a@@ , this case of the now rescued Nigeri@@ ans is no exception@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , a call for help via mobile phone video was new to them@@ .
International organizations are critici@@ zing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as in@@ human@@ e.
The North African country@@ , which is largely controlled by mili@@ ti@@ as@@ , is the main country of passage for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe@@ .

La@@ sch@@ et urges Turkey to act according to the rule of law
Cologne - According to the Minister President of NRW Ar@@ min La@@ sch@@ et (@@ CD@@ U@@ )@@ , during his talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan@@ , called for the rule of law in Tur@@ key@@ .
The relationships of both countries are currently ‘@@ over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed@@ ’@@ , La@@ sch@@ et said on Satur@@ day@@ , following a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne air@@ port@@ .
These concerns are related to all the arrest wa@@ ves@@ , freedom of media and religi@@ on@@ .
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that "@@ if in the future relations are going to become normal and if economic relations are going to deep@@ en@@ , then the rule of law is a very important condition@@ .@@ "
According to La@@ sch@@ et@@ , he also referred to the cases of Germans being imprisoned in Tur@@ key@@ .
He had expressed the hope that freedom of expression would be respec@@ te@@ d.
Ther@@ eu@@ pon Erdogan once again underlined the independence of Turkish system of jus@@ tic@@ e.
The conversation between La@@ sch@@ et and Erdogan had been transferred to the building of the Executive Transport Wing of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Air@@ port@@ .
Origin@@ ally it should have taken place at Wah@@ n castle - but the castle owners declined due to political views against Erdo@@ gan@@ .
After the speech Erdogan went to the opening of the Di@@ ti@@ b Mosque in Colo@@ g@@ ne@@ .
La@@ sch@@ et declined a joint appearance in the buil@@ ding@@ .
He did say thou@@ gh@@ : ‘@@ The Muslims who go to this mosqu@@ e@@ , are also citizens of our country@@ ’@@ .

Lack of trust in the US@@ : North Korea demands disarmament

Foreign Minister R@@ i calls for a concession from Washing@@ ton@@ .
North Kore@@ a@@ ’@@ s Foreign Minister R@@ i Y@@ ong Ho@@ , speaking at the UN General Deb@@ ate@@ , has accused the US government of st@@ alling negotiations for a nucle@@ ar@@ -@@ free Korean peninsula through continued sanc@@ tions@@ .
The recent standstill has seen the US implementing coer@@ cive measu@@ res@@ , which are lethal to trust@@ -@@ buil@@ ding@@ , said R@@ i in New Yor@@ k.
Dis@@ armament under these circumstance would be unthinkable for North Kore@@ a.
Without any trust in the US@@ , there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves fir@@ st@@ , the North Korean head diplomat sa@@ i@@ d.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘@@ brought to its kne@@ es@@ ’ due to the sanc@@ tions@@ , is ‘@@ a pipe dream of people who don@@ ’@@ t know us@@ ’@@ .
To build trust his country has stopped its atom and missile tests and has destroyed a nuclear test system@@ , R@@ i sa@@ i@@ d.
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the USA has shown no "@@ corresponding reac@@ tions@@ " to th@@ at@@ , the minister critic@@ is@@ ed@@ .
Last year al@@ one@@ , because of North Kore@@ a@@ ’@@ s nuclear and missile program@@ , the UN Security Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three tim@@ es@@ .
In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United N@@ ations@@ .

The Ho@@ T serv@@ ed@@ : New kitchen with donations from the community

The start was not easy@@ , as Hen@@ ri@@ ette West@@ bu@@ er@@ , head of the Ho@@ T@@ , remember@@ s.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break@@ , and we were well prepared for the big day@@ .
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break@@ : A power ou@@ tage had cut the power to the huge two@@ -@@ part refriger@@ ator@@ , the food was spoiled and had to be thrown out@@ .
Now we had to start from the beginning aga@@ in@@ : We got a lot of support from friends and neighbor@@ s@@ , but the children and youth wanted to do it al@@ one@@ , says West@@ bu@@ er@@ .

Out of frustration over criticism from their own rank@@ s@@ , the head of the Essen Tafel@@ , Jörg S@@ art@@ or@@ , has given up his position@@ .

Too many had stab@@ bed me in the back@@ .
The head of the NRW association of the Tafel@@ , Wolfgang Wei@@ ler@@ swi@@ st@@ , expressed understanding for the decision of his long@@ time deputy to d@@ pa@@ .
Sar@@ tor took the sharp criticism to heart@@ .

But Sar@@ tor is still working for the Essen@@ er Tafel - “@@ six days a week@@ , nothing has changed about it@@ ,@@ ” says Wei@@ ler@@ swi@@ st@@ .
Sar@@ tor criticized colleagues from other Tafel associations in "@@ Welt am Sonn@@ tag@@ .@@ "@@ .

The next two classics against Ajax and Glad@@ bach will now determine the interim conclusion for Ni@@ ko Ko@@ vac@@ ’@@ s ten@@ ure@@ .
Under no circumstances should the first small drop in power with the new coach Ni@@ ko Ko@@ vac@@ a should increase for Munich to the autumn minim@@ um@@ .
A week ago@@ , everyone still thought we were unbe@@ at@@ able@@ .
Now we are overtaken by reali@@ ty@@ , said Thomas Müller after the 0@@ -2 defeat of Her@@ tha B@@ SC and asks for a return leg in the Champions League du@@ el with Ajax Amster@@ dam@@ .
Any@@ one who knows us@@ , is aware that we are really angry and that is why we will c@@ rank up on Tu@@ es@@ day@@ .
For the first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no go@@ als@@ , as at the same time two mandatory pre@@ season games in series without a vic@@ tor@@ y@@ , the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dort@@ mund@@ .
The overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti at the end of September 201@@ 7@@ , but the champions shall be a@@ ware@@ .
The FC Augsburg with the 1@@ :@@ 1 ratio having its long running man@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ man tactics and the Berlin through its playful pin@@ pri@@ cks over the outside have delivered within two days two similar blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ ts@@ , as the last over@@ power@@ ing appearing of Bayern fai@@ le@@ d.

A win over Amsterdam and Bor@@ ussi@@ a Mon@@ cheng@@ lad@@ bach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise the tone will probably get wor@@ se@@ .
So before the second premier class appearance in this season after the 2@@ -@@ 0 over Ben@@ fica Lis@@ bon@@ , Ko@@ vac undertook no extraordinary measu@@ res@@ .
As it was plan@@ ne@@ d@@ , after the day off on Sunday started quick preparation for the second preliminary round match against Aj@@ ax@@ , who beat A@@ EK Athens confidently 3@@ -@@ 0 as well@@ .
Now the@@ y@@ ’@@ ve scored a victory over us in two gam@@ es@@ , but we will also reach our goals aga@@ in@@ , announced captain of the national team Manuel Neu@@ er@@ .
Al@@ ready after the lost cup final against Eintra@@ cht Frankfur@@ t@@ , at the same position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kim@@ mi@@ ch.

On the seventh match day of the previous season Bayern was even five points behind Dort@@ mund@@ , which has now taken over with one point ah@@ e@@ ad@@ .

DF@@ B boss comes under fire@@ : Ö@@ z@@ il@@ -@@ C@@ aus@@ a@@ : Shar@@ p attack of Erdogan on Grin@@ del
The Turkish president Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mes@@ ut Ö@@ zil and Il@@ kay Gün@@ do@@ gan in Germany amidst serious accus@@ ations@@ .
The DF@@ B president Grin@@ del admits mistakes but upholds the associ@@ ation@@ ’@@ s line@@ .
Now will be created a new post@@ .
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grin@@ del fought on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mes@@ ut Ö@@ zil disp@@ u@@ te@@ .
After the Turkish President criticized the speech of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of large Di@@ ti@@ b Mosque in Colo@@ g@@ ne@@ , the head of DF@@ B upheld the associ@@ ation@@ ’@@ s line@@ .
Early on Sunday mor@@ ning@@ , Gr@@ ind@@ l@@ , who had been personally attacked by Ö@@ z@@ il@@ , reported on the consequences of the issue on the Mainz ZDF “@@ Sport studi@@ o@@ ”@@ .
As we have a lot of players with a migration background in the U team@@ s@@ , in future we must draw very specific conclu@@ sions@@ , so something like this this does not happen aga@@ in@@ , said the 57@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old and plans to get a national player without a migration background as an additional integration offici@@ al@@ .
Grin@@ del also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DF@@ B.
The latter was very critical of the racism against Ö@@ zil and Il@@ kay Gün@@ do@@ gan@@ .
Our Mes@@ ut Ö@@ z@@ il@@ , born and raised in German@@ y@@ , and our Il@@ kay@@ .
They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed with them in Eng@@ land@@ ,@@ " said Erdogan in Dom@@ stadt on Satur@@ day@@ .
Frank@@ ly speak@@ ing@@ , as their pre@@ sident@@ , I could not accept the fact that our two young men@@ , who had been risen to the German national team@@ , were exclu@@ de@@ d.
Grin@@ del pointed at Gün@@ do@@ gan@@ '@@ s statement that in contrast to Ö@@ z@@ il@@ , after the World Cup aff@@ air@@ , which had been taken photos of the two with Erdo@@ gan@@ , he felt that he was "@@ reasonably treated by the DF@@ B@@ "@@ .
He also said he wanted to stand up for players in fut@@ ure@@ .
That thing they say@@ : If I win - I@@ ’@@ m German@@ , if I lose - I@@ ’@@ m a migrant - that will not work@@ .
I am very sorry that he had such an impres@@ sion@@ , said Grindel@@ .
I@@ ’@@ ve always said that we had to defend Mes@@ ut more@@ .
Y@@ et he does not see grounds for Ö@@ zil to return to the national team@@ .
As a consequ@@ ence@@ , in addition to the native Brazilian Cac@@ au and C@@ elia Sa@@ sic of Cameroon ancest@@ ry@@ , now should be appointed an additional integration represent@@ ati@@ ve@@ .
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influ@@ encer in society and football and sa@@ ys@@ : The issue is an important one@@ , we need to do something about it@@ ’@@ , this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local team@@ s@@ , where integration needs to work@@ ’@@ , Grin@@ del sa@@ i@@ d.
Des@@ p@@ ite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ö@@ zil aff@@ air@@ , he wants to run for the post of DF@@ B President again next year@@ .
I do my work and take care I do it as well as possi@@ ble@@ , Grin@@ del sa@@ i@@ d.

Hamburg - Al@@ most a year after marriage came into force for every@@ one@@ , the SPD politician Johannes K@@ ahr@@ s married his long@@ -@@ term boyfriend Christoph Roh@@ de@@ .
The two exchanged vo@@ ws on Saturday in Ham@@ bur@@ g.
K@@ ahr@@ s previously told the “@@ Bild@@ ” newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them@@ .

Switzerland is starting an electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situ@@ ations@@ .
Swis@@ stran@@ spl@@ ant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent@@ .
(@@ d@@ pa@@ ) Switzerland starts its electronic register for organ donation this Mon@@ day@@ .
This should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situ@@ ations@@ .
T@@ hose who want to donate their organs in cases of de@@ ath@@ , can register them@@ sel@@ ves@@ .
Your wishes will then be available to Swis@@ stran@@ splan@@ t@@ , if require@@ d.
Swis@@ stran@@ spl@@ ant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent@@ , as is the case in German@@ y@@ .
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have donor car@@ ds@@ , says Franz Imm@@ er@@ , Director of the Swis@@ stran@@ spl@@ ant found@@ ation@@ .
But only in five percent of cas@@ es@@ , a card is found at the crucial moment when don@@ ating is possi@@ ble@@ .
In over 60 percent of convers@@ ations@@ , relatives do not know the dead person@@ ’@@ s inten@@ tions@@ .
You then have to decide on behalf of the dec@@ eas@@ ed@@ , according to their wish@@ , which is often very stress@@ ful@@ , says Imm@@ er@@ .
A similar registration system already exists in Great Brit@@ ain@@ .
In German@@ y@@ , the recording of details about possible organ donation on the health card has been consider@@ ed@@ , as stated by the speaker for the Federal Office for Health Educ@@ ation@@ , Mar@@ ita Völker@@ -@@ Alber@@ t.
There is no register where people can record their wish@@ es@@ , for or against organ don@@ ation@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ .
Federal Health Minister has spoken about new guidelines for organ don@@ ation@@ .

In the various calcul@@ ations@@ , the candidates get surprise tas@@ ks@@ , for which they need to find a solution strate@@ gy@@ .
The main judge said the Germans also had a good chan@@ ce@@ .

On Monday farmers are allowed to start the annual hedge bank main@@ tain@@ ance
On Monday Schles@@ wi@@ g@@ -@@ Holstein farmers can start with the annual hedge bank main@@ tain@@ anc@@ e.
For around 200 year@@ s@@ , the "@@ green ram@@ par@@ ts@@ " which are unique in German@@ y@@ , have shaped the landscape of the fore@@ st@@ -@@ poor state@@ .
The tree and under@@ growth hed@@ ges@@ , up to five meters wi@@ de@@ , are ‘@@ forest replac@@ e@@ ments@@ ’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas of re@@ treat@@ .
Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered habit@@ ats@@ , through which the exchange of organisms can still function@@ , as the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (@@ N@@ AB@@ U@@ ) in Schles@@ wi@@ g@@ -@@ Hol@@ stein@@ , Ingo Ludwi@@ cho@@ w@@ ski@@ , sa@@ i@@ d.
Hedge banks are living fences
In the year 17@@ 66 the hedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI who ruled over Schles@@ wi@@ g@@ -@@ Hol@@ stein@@ .
The ‘@@ living fen@@ ces@@ ’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fen@@ c@@ ing@@ , they also provided farmers with fire@@ wood and beams for their half@@ -@@ tim@@ bered hous@@ es@@ .
From that time comes the name "@@ K@@ nick@@ "@@ : By "@@ bending over@@ " (@@ Um@@ kni@@ cken@@ ) the bran@@ ch@@ es@@ , the den@@ se@@ , intertw@@ ined boundaries could develop@@ .
To@@ day@@ , around 45 000 kilometers of hed@@ ger@@ o@@ ws stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea@@ , giving the image of a woo@@ de@@ d@@ , diver@@ sely structured landscap@@ e.
According to the N@@ AB@@ U@@ ’@@ s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habit@@ at@@ .
One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there@@ .
The hedge banks can only fulfill their ecologically important role if they are maintained accordingly in the winter@@ .
O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e@@ , it is stun@@ ted to a spar@@ se tree line@@ , which causes not only losses in biodiversity but also in the wind@@ breaking effec@@ t@@ , said Ludwi@@ cho@@ w@@ ski@@ .
The hedge bank ma@@ inten@@ ance@@ , according to the Ministry of Agri@@ cul@@ ture@@ , can only take place outside the breeding period or from October until March@@ .




After the tsunami on Su@@ la@@ wes@@ i an Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radi@@ ka P@@ into describes the local situation on Su@@ la@@ wes@@ i island following the earthquakes and tsunami in the interview with Redaktions@@ Netzwerk Deutschland (@@ R@@ ND@@ )@@ :
W@@ ere you on location when the tsunami took plac@@ e@@ ?
No@@ , I was in Jakarta on Java island at the time@@ .
At the time of the earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es@@ , my wife called me@@ , she was in Pal@@ u.
When I heard about the tsun@@ ami@@ , I immediately returned to Su@@ la@@ we@@ si@@ .
I arrived there on Sunday mor@@ ning@@ , because I still had to drive for more than 20 hours by car after the flight as the airport at Pal@@ u was closed at the time@@ .
What is the situation on the island now@@ ?
The national government has opened the airport aga@@ in@@ , so aid supply can be flown in@@ .
When I arri@@ ved@@ , I saw the houses on the coast@@ , which were completely destro@@ y@@ ed@@ .
Our ‘@@ World Vision@@ ’ office is also destro@@ y@@ ed@@ , but we have set something up provi@@ sion@@ all@@ y@@ , where other people have also been accomm@@ o@@ dat@@ ed@@ .
Where are the people of Su@@ la@@ wes@@ i living now@@ ?
Many ran to the surrounding hill@@ s@@ , where they held out through fear of another tsunami and earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ e@@ , and where there is no access to water and foo@@ d.
Many stopped in front of their houses with after@@ shocks still being experi@@ enc@@ ed@@ .
As many food shops and gas stations are completely shut@@ , some people are stealing provisions and gas@@ ol@@ ine@@ .
The public services have completely shut down and the national government is hel@@ ping@@ .
Even a prison was destro@@ y@@ ed@@ , the prisoners are running around free@@ , and searching for them is difficul@@ t.
There are still lots of bodies lying aro@@ und@@ , many people have not been found and are mis@@ sin@@ g.
How is the communication and information flow on the is@@ land@@ ?
At the moment we have mobile recep@@ tion@@ , which did not work previously and we have been receiving information via radi@@ o.
Many people are still looking for their chil@@ dren@@ , neighbors and other person@@ s@@ , not knowing if they are alive and where they are sta@@ y@@ ing@@ , because people were not at home during the earthquake and were on the way to work@@ , for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .
The tsunami warning system did not work correc@@ t@@ ly@@ .
Do you have any information about th@@ is@@ ?
We do not know the reasons for th@@ is@@ , but when the all@@ -@@ clear was gi@@ ven@@ , many people thought ‘@@ OK@@ , no tsun@@ ami@@ ’@@ , and then it cam@@ e.
In other regions not affected by the tsun@@ ami@@ , there was false information about a tsunami hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding hill@@ s.
An island like Su@@ la@@ wes@@ i that sits on the Pacific rim of fire@@ , is not prepared for earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es@@ ?
Y@@ et there are earthquakes every day@@ , but this one was the wor@@ st@@ .
We normally know how to react to an earthquake and are trained for evacu@@ ations@@ .
But the complete infrastructure has collap@@ sed@@ , the earthquake has affected a lot of pe@@ op@@ le@@ .

Brett Kav@@ an@@ au@@ gh@@ : High@@ -@@ speed FBI investigation
Time is extremely tight and the number of planned interro@@ gations is very restric@@ te@@ d.
Republicans in the US Senate want the break@@ -@@ neck speed FBI investigation to help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kav@@ an@@ au@@ gh@@ , which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual mis@@ conduc@@ t.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clarify more than 30 years of suspected incidents from years back@@ .
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kav@@ an@@ au@@ gh@@ '@@ s nomin@@ ation@@ , which has involved a culture war@@ , had been triggered on Fri@@ day@@ .
After an 8@@ -@@ hour hearing of Kav@@ an@@ au@@ gh and the first acc@@ user Christine Blas@@ ey F@@ ord@@ , in which the lawyer directed angry ti@@ rades at the opposition democ@@ rats@@ , the Senate Judi@@ ciary Committee wanted to pave the way for final confirmation of the ultra@@ -@@ sensitive judge at the US Supreme Cour@@ t.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Fla@@ ke@@ , against his original announ@@ ce@@ ment@@ , suddenly declared he would agre@@ e@@ , but demanded an FBI investig@@ ation@@ .
Fol@@ lowing tu@@ mul@@ tuous scenes his party friends agre@@ ed@@ .
President Tru@@ mp@@ , who described the bitter arguments on Thursday as a ‘@@ sc@@ am@@ ’@@ , then included further attacks against the women and spoke in contrast about a ‘@@ blessing in disgu@@ ise@@ ’@@ .
He said that this way any ling@@ ering doubts could be elimin@@ at@@ ed@@ .
Later@@ , Trump attacked Democrats sharply at a rally because they opposed Kav@@ an@@ au@@ gh@@ : "@@ They try to block and destro@@ y.@@ "
Trump is ordering an FBI investigation into the Kav@@ an@@ au@@ gh case
The White House has also severely narro@@ wed the powers of the investig@@ ator@@ s.

According to the ‘@@ New York Tim@@ es@@ ’ only four witnesses will be he@@ ard@@ .

FC Schal@@ ke 04 after defeating Main@@ z@@ : You could feel the fear
Trainer Domenico Ted@@ esco and Schal@@ ke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Main@@ z.
There is a great sense of relief at Schal@@ ke after the first win of the season@@ .
Never@@ thel@@ ess@@ , time was also a factor against Main@@ z.
Gel@@ sen@@ kirchen - By now@@ , Christian Hei@@ del is well@@ -@@ known for being a huge p@@ essi@@ mist at football mat@@ ch@@ es@@ .
The home game against Mainz 05 was no differ@@ ent@@ .
I saw every ball going in@@ .
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty are@@ a@@ , said the sports director of Schal@@ ke 04 - and breath@@ ed a si@@ gh of re@@ lief@@ .
After all@@ , the "@@ royal blu@@ es@@ " had managed to seal the narrow 1@@ :@@ 0 win against Mainz over the course of the match and thus celebrated the first victory of the season@@ .
In fac@@ t@@ , things could have been very differ@@ ent@@ .
After Alessandro Schö@@ pf (@@ 11@@ th@@ ) had given the team of head coach Domenico Ted@@ esco the lead and therefore secur@@ ity@@ , Ted@@ esco sa@@ id@@ : "@@ In sum@@ , the first half was good@@ , both in terms of how we played and in terms of pres@@ sing@@ "@@ . As the match continu@@ ed@@ , mental strength became increasingly import@@ ant@@ .
Schö@@ pf is usually not an aerial threat
The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me@@ , said Heidel@@ : ‘@@ I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench@@ ’@@ .
The boys were afraid to squ@@ ander the lead and therefore kept re@@ treat@@ ing@@ .
And threw everything they had into our defen@@ se@@ .
To hold on to the first three points of the season@@ .
We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoul@@ der@@ s@@ , said Schö@@ pf@@ , whose scoring header played no insignificant part@@ : "@@ And I am actually the worst header on the team@@ .@@ "
But in the end@@ , victory is all that coun@@ ts@@ .
The relief was felt throughout the entire ar@@ en@@ a@@ , not least by Ted@@ es@@ co@@ .
We wanted to start strong in the early stages and make a fire@@ work of it@@ , said Schal@@ ke@@ ’@@ s head co@@ ach@@ .
The win was an important one@@ .
Fin@@ ally we can enjoy ourselves for a few hour@@ s.
I am ver@@ y@@ , very happy for the team and the fan@@ s.
We played smart@@ , calmly and with courage@@ , that is how we must approach matches over 90 minutes
The biggest shortcoming of the afterno@@ on@@ : The "@@ Royal Blu@@ es@@ " missed their chance to establish control over the match ear@@ ly@@ .
After all@@ , they did get their chan@@ ces@@ , for example via the strong Y@@ ev@@ hen Kon@@ p@@ pl@@ yan@@ ka@@ , who hit the cross@@ bar twice (@@ 59@@ th@@ /@@ 7@@ 2@@ n@@ d@@ ) or A@@ mine Har@@ it (@@ 6@@ 2@@ n@@ d@@ )@@ .
That way it would not have been such a nerve wre@@ cking vic@@ tor@@ y@@ , said Ted@@ es@@ co@@ : "@@ You really could feel the fear a little bit@@ .@@ "
So I am glad that we won@@ .
He was not the only one at Schal@@ ke@@ .

Prof. Dr. Ala@@ din El@@ -@@ Maf@@ a@@ al@@ ani discusses integr@@ ation@@ : A discussion at eye level
Professor Doctor Ala@@ din El@@ -@@ Maf@@ a@@ al@@ ani is standing before them@@ .
He has once again accepted the invitation from Ernst Rei@@ ling and Lore Hau@@ schil@@ d.
For many year@@ , I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Gre@@ ven@@ , explains the founder and chairman of the "@@ R@@ eck@@ en@@ felder Treff@@ " - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "@@ Kultur@@ politi@@ k@@ " alli@@ anc@@ e.
El@@ -@@ Maf@@ a@@ al@@ ani cas@@ ually starts the read@@ ing@@ , describing the writing process of the book@@ , talking about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehen@@ si@@ bl@@ y@@ .
With a lot of ge@@ stu@@ res@@ , tangible numbers and a joke or two@@ , he introduces the audience to one of the most contentious topic@@ s@@ : Migration and integr@@ ation@@ .
Why are there increasingly conflic@@ ts@@ , despite successful integr@@ ation@@ ?
The Syri@@ an@@ -@@ born author uses a metaphor to answer the question@@ .
The German society sits at the big table@@ , the migrants of the first generation at the kid@@ ’@@ s table@@ .
Thei@@ r children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table@@ .
The third generation of migrants is born in German@@ y@@ . They always sat at the big table and now want to have a say to@@ o.
This leads to conflic@@ ts@@ .
There@@ fore@@ , it is not of importance whether one is politically right or le@@ ft@@ , but@@ : "@@ Am I for or against an open soci@@ et@@ y@@ ?@@ " he emphasi@@ zes@@ .
At first rather restra@@ in@@ ed@@ , then the discussion round gets more and more li@@ vel@@ y@@ .
And there is a need for disc@@ us@@ sion@@ .
An Afghan refugee reports from his per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ve@@ , and two teachers explain how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among stu@@ dent@@ s.
