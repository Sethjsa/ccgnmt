<seg id="2">Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Mesut Özil to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".</seg>
<seg id="4">In spite of the debate going on for months about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-match national player Özil.</seg>
<seg id="5">I would be happy if Mesut Özil continued to play for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">At some point of time I also assumed that it will happen, said Grindel.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="8">The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and that he is not ready for a discussion with national coach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.</seg>
<seg id="9">He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows that in football ‘if you leave a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that this discussion did not happen before’.</seg>

<seg id="1">Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes longer than planned</seg>
<seg id="2">There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘Automobilwoche’ trade journal.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, the taskforce will be dissolved soon.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mertens now says: ‘At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked out.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.</seg>
<seg id="7">The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery at Audi parent company Volkswagen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘serious, organizational changes’, to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.</seg>
<seg id="9">The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue this discussion on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission values.</seg>
<seg id="11">He must have known about the tampering or deliberately ignored it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.</seg>
<seg id="13">After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘Heilbronner Stimme’.</seg>
<seg id="14">Essentially, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.</seg>
<seg id="15">The segment in itself is a difficult one, he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schot is for electromobility.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grindel seeking re-election - Lahm to join the Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)</seg>
<seg id="2">Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of the DFB again in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="3">I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF’s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".</seg>
<seg id="4">A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do.</seg>
<seg id="5">And then you have to see what kind of support you get.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The next vote will be held at the DFB’s national conference on September 27, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Presidential Board.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting matters, said Grindel.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her family back to Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="15">If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says, ‘the issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, ‘this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.</seg>

<seg id="3">Get involved wherever you can, said Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thank you for coming, this is a dream.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with tassels and a gold microphone.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am nervous, I am sweating, but it’s OK because I’m here and ready to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, government representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lasted for hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was a scary moment when many spectators mistook the noise of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to run away.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a short panic with people running in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.</seg>

<seg id="12">Nobody is trying to injure anyone, said Martin.</seg>

<seg id="15">If you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases online.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Flake did join his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage in calling for more equal rights between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate supporting the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, which offended many women.</seg>
<seg id="19">At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects these.</seg>

<seg id="2">His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">You have to look twice, though: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.</seg>
<seg id="4">The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!</seg>
<seg id="5">Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “Schellfischposten.”</seg>
<seg id="6">Moderator Ina Müller often cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood and their tongues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Quite a few celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="9">This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".</seg>
<seg id="10">The trip didn’t do the actor any good, though.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fitz.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he is not ill, he only has quite a hangover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rule two: Never drink "die schwarze Sau".</seg>
<seg id="16">And Spritz.</seg>
<seg id="17">And also pass on Ina’s round of eggnog at half past two."</seg>
<seg id="18">The long night is really showing on the 43-year-olds’ face.</seg>
<seg id="19">His fans posted a couple of tips for getting rid of a hangover.</seg>
<seg id="20">They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - painkillers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.</seg>
<seg id="22">We still don't know how Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at night.</seg>

<seg id="1">Treysa has struggled against vandalism and garbage</seg>
<seg id="2">Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attempts are made to remedy the rampant vandalism, but there are hardly any signs of solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="7">The problem has already been addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is no solution so far.</seg>
<seg id="9">Suggestions ranged from transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.</seg>
<seg id="10">I think, the latter would be the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory council.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not just about the noise, there are also disturbances due to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanne Klippert.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actions are only proverbial drops in the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="16">They are annoyed that the rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.</seg>
<seg id="18">If it suffers the same fate, it will cost dearly.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common property.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, this would require a police patrol to come out.</seg>
<seg id="21">In principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development of the Haaße hill.</seg>
<seg id="22">It needs to be made more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="23">So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequented.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German’, agreed the ADFC members.</seg>
<seg id="26">ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.</seg>
<seg id="28">In heavy traffic, cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and especially for children.</seg>

<seg id="6">Seven acts performed, from a one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.</seg>
<seg id="7">This contest is a novelty, explains district mayor Joachim Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have not seen something like this in other districts.</seg>
<seg id="9">What did the songwriters sing about?</seg>

<seg id="12">The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over and over again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Karl Franke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the artists.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.</seg>
<seg id="16">From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.</seg>
<seg id="17">And Alvin Jasic has uploaded a lot of YouTube videos.</seg>
<seg id="18">It’s not about winning, Franke had said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup catering businesses.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.</seg>
<seg id="21">Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.</seg>
<seg id="23">Like everyone else, the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.</seg>
<seg id="25">The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="27">They considered the event a complete success.</seg>
<seg id="28">Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"</seg>
<seg id="2">The players form two teams and sit opposite one another.</seg>
<seg id="3">For each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil.</seg>
<seg id="4">This ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, on the cards it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="6">2. Fenster.</seg>
<seg id="7">3. Cube.</seg>
<seg id="8">4. Solidʺ.</seg>
<seg id="9">These are the terms that need to be coded.</seg>
<seg id="10">So the terms are not guessed, the codes are.</seg>
<seg id="11">Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.</seg>
<seg id="12">They get a code card that has "3.4.2." etc. written on it.</seg>
<seg id="13">In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret film that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The task in this case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "solid" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins the game.</seg>
<seg id="15">The encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read some history books and knows about the defenestration of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="16">This then progresses, round for round, team by team.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is true that one does not know the terms of the other side - but with every clue the encryptor gives, you’re closer to finding them out.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the term should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy. Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.</seg>
<seg id="19">The most cryptic ‘Decrypto’ is the precept unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="20">The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the web will make it easier.</seg>
<seg id="22">But once you have started, you’ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.</seg>
<seg id="23">Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few words, but it’s much easier to play in small groups.</seg>
<seg id="24">And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives</seg>
<seg id="2">For decades the depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest.</seg>
<seg id="3">1991 put an end to a piece of railway history.</seg>
<seg id="4">The crashing from bumper to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.</seg>
<seg id="5">This did not bother anybody.</seg>
<seg id="6">The squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was pure railway.</seg>
<seg id="8">Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel’s Pressig homeland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the starting point for the steep mountain section to the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of about 220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Previously trains and locomotives housed in Pressig were needed to handle this.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroad maintenance division.</seg>
<seg id="13">The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of experience.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.</seg>
<seg id="16">The electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomotives.</seg>
<seg id="17">From 1977 they were still used with freight trains.</seg>
<seg id="18">By 1991 at least 10,000 wagons were shunted.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the remainder in the year 1991.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heidrich: ‘It’s a shame that better use of the location is not envisaged, also with regard to freight traffic’.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.</seg>
<seg id="22">10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dinkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="24">On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.</seg>
<seg id="25">The shunters and wheel scotches took care of the heaviest rail traffic work, remembers Dinkel.</seg>
<seg id="26">Each mistake could have fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="27">Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and current pictures there are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach.</seg>
<seg id="2">Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which took place in the open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt property in Mittelehrenbach.</seg>
<seg id="3">It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) in the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".</seg>
<seg id="4">This opened its doors for the 15th year.</seg>
<seg id="5">The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibits.</seg>
<seg id="6">21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.</seg>
<seg id="7">The host Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="8">He had been there from the first hour.</seg>
<seg id="9">As has Volker Hahn, who has made a name for himself as the main organiser as well as an artist.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement some days ago.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in experienced, young hands with excellent future prospects.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing flyers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Once again this year there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (art and enjoyment), available at every art station.</seg>
<seg id="14">The poster this year ‘outdance the Betzn’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception of the special exhibit.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was possible to persuade Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provide musical framing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are metal or ceramic works of art, often accented with color.</seg>
<seg id="19">Already at the entrance to the property, on the right side, the visitor is awaited by the "Glücksbaum" (luck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a tree stump, brightened with color, equipped with 20 pin wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes for a sound piece.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sun shining through the bushes in the background adds a magical touch to the object, inviting visitors to linger.</seg>
<seg id="22">Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to dedicate three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are many parts moving in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="24">Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heavenly Child).</seg>
<seg id="25">At the end, Volker Hahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from clay, cement and stainless steel.</seg>
<seg id="26">The ‘wind chime performance’ theme wanders through the multi-purpose art exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="27">The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31, 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1">50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday</seg>
<seg id="2">1968 - That was the time of the protest and the student movement.</seg>
<seg id="3">And also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least five of them.</seg>
<seg id="5">In no case did they want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would be no more singing life in the district.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has become a legend by now: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came to existence.</seg>
<seg id="7">That was 50 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in the “House of Encounter.”</seg>
<seg id="9">It will be full today, senses chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.</seg>
<seg id="11">They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The traditional festival was back again in time for the 50th anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="14">It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="15">Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “House of Encounter,” but rather sat comfortably around tables.</seg>
<seg id="16">In between, everyone could dance. DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and heated up the dance floor.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of course, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten would let their voices sound.</seg>
<seg id="18">Matching the occasion, happy songs were quite fitting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Almost set: "So ein Tag, so wunderschön wie heute."</seg>
<seg id="20">There was also the “Rüdesheim wine” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which many guests had in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="21">“Humulus lupulus,” which is the Latin name for ‘hops,’ references another cool drink.</seg>
<seg id="22">The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was once again very confident.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's just fun to sing under his direction, said Holstiege. "He has such an easy way, he accomplishes a masterpiece every time.". By the way, this time not only men were presented vocally.</seg>
<seg id="24">The ladies’ choir “High C” were also guests, whose repertoire above all includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.</seg>
<seg id="25">To round it all off there was some poetry.</seg>
<seg id="26">Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.</seg>
<seg id="27">And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was also a big Tombola game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The proceeds are to go towards financing the children of the Albatros Youth Center visiting the all-weather zoo.</seg>

<seg id="1">Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee</seg>
<seg id="2">The promoted team marches on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really well in league three.</seg>
<seg id="4">No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing their thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">And with the 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals BW Aasee, they did really well.</seg>
<seg id="6">It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, says the reasonably satisfied coach.</seg>
<seg id="7">BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed with him: “This is a defeat that we can live with.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are not dissatisfied.” Quite the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the evening, at Ronja de Boer’s belated birthday party, the mood was good, the game was done.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the third set, the guests had a set ball.</seg>
<seg id="12">If you bring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows from years of experience.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ultimately USC made everything clear with its experienced players and finished it out.</seg>
<seg id="14">We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.</seg>
<seg id="15">That was not our undoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've seen a great game of volleyball at times, Annacker did not struggle with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="17">After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents’ journey goes.</seg>
<seg id="18">It’s simply too early for that, says Axel Büring.</seg>
<seg id="19">He only feels vindicated in one thing: “The 3rd Women's League has an unbelievably good level of play.</seg>
<seg id="20">It’s not even close with regional league volleyball.” They don't even want to look down towards the fourth league.</seg>
<seg id="21">If they don’t want to lose hope, they have to look up.</seg>
<seg id="22">But a conclusion can't be drawn until after ten or eleven games.</seg>
<seg id="23">The next game is at Emlichheim on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Aasee will compete in Essen on October 14.</seg>

<seg id="1">About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for her husband</seg>
<seg id="2">The "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller a star.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.</seg>
<seg id="4">Heide Keller (76) became famous in her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘Dream Boat’, but on 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.</seg>
<seg id="5">The series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="6">This could also have been a reason.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because this work became a part of me, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".</seg>
<seg id="8">She used to be "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dream Ship".</seg>
<seg id="9">Because now journalists called her only as Heide Keller.</seg>
<seg id="10">I don’t know if he was happy with this.</seg>
<seg id="11">She thinks that it possible that her husband might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."</seg>
<seg id="12">Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to discover my fears and my weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">In plain language it means: I’m pretending," as she explains further.</seg>
<seg id="14">She always had the feeling of ‘not being enough for him.</seg>
<seg id="15">He saw in me an emancipated woman, which actually I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.</seg>
<seg id="16">I wanted our love to last forever’.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘Yes’ again, ‘although I was scared it could go wrong again’.</seg>
<seg id="18">The day before the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.</seg>
<seg id="19">The marriage to von Borsody failed as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">Why did it never work out with men?</seg>
<seg id="21">Because I wanted too much.</seg>
<seg id="22">Keller was in love at that time "as in the movie.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this vision is not compatible with daily life.</seg>
<seg id="24">I am too naive to approach love."</seg>

<seg id="1">The moth, who regularly explores the city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, has now attempted this on the ZFF opening party.</seg>
<seg id="2">Not really a moth, just a little shady.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the film festival though, where the more or less famous want to bathe in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="5">So this late Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.</seg>
<seg id="7">This evening, whatever the reason, it literally stinks in the gents area.</seg>
<seg id="8">So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film "Green Book", like every year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown originate from the whole globe.</seg>
<seg id="10">What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass inside.</seg>
<seg id="12">Inside, the invited are crowded together, they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="14">And the highlight is: that the shop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has been like this for years and seems to function without any major losses.</seg>
<seg id="16">You must just love the country for it!</seg>
<seg id="17">The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the escalator if you are wearing a long dress".</seg>
<seg id="18">Should this be two separate instructions, he has ignored the dress code.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is a conditional construction that has undoubtedly saved lives.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival award.</seg>
<seg id="21">The mixture getting the prize for the best drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - not compulsory.</seg>
<seg id="22">And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the brand mentioned for years, is also not there on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is one face, however, between local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that is familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.</seg>
<seg id="24">Its main character will not be far away.</seg>

<seg id="2">Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat.” His protégés were “devastated” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Over long periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.</seg>
<seg id="4">We only overslept the initial phase, said the ASV coach annoyed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Quickly, the home team led with 8-1, also the early break, that Bieletzki had taken, did not pan out.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki.</seg>
<seg id="7">At halftime, they were only two goals behind.</seg>
<seg id="8">Senden's best player, Marius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the change, things got even better from the visitors’ point of view.</seg>
<seg id="10">After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15-15.</seg>
<seg id="11">Four minutes before the alarm, the lead was still only three goals (29-26).</seg>
<seg id="12">And then?</seg>
<seg id="13">The impartial got in on the action.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bieletzki usually does not seek blame with others.</seg>
<seg id="15">But: The 120-second time penalty caused by Steffen Mühlhoff “was a joke.”</seg>
<seg id="16">LIT had an opportunity and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">The boys fought great, defended well and repeatedly threw the ball on the empty goal.</seg>
<seg id="18">But compliments don’t win games.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now it must be a damned victory, said Bieletzki.</seg>
<seg id="20">ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).</seg>

<seg id="2">After the quarrels of recent weeks, the grand coalition conceded several poll low blows.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey indicates that the SPD falls behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is reviewed critically.</seg>
<seg id="4">Berlin - For the first time the AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the weekly survey of the polling institute, the AfD has gained one point and holds 17 percent, the SPD, compared to the previous week, has lost a point and holds 16 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also CDU and CSU lose a point and hold only 27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far this is the lowest rating for the Union in the Sunday trend.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Greens achieve 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">If on Sunday were the Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes according to Emnid.</seg>
<seg id="10">The large coalition for all the large research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, lost the majority in the ‘Sunday question’.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government parties are coming up with 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).</seg>
<seg id="12">In the 2017 general election, together they received 53.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The bandwidth is also great for the other parties: The AfD, in many polls holds the position of second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Greens receive vote quotas of 12.5 to 17 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left have an average of 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Such surveys have an uncertainty of plus/minus 2 to 3 percent, according to statistical reasons, depending on the share of votes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the 2017 general election however the backing for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly in the population.</seg>
<seg id="18">Currently only 48 percent of citizens believe Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as is revealed in the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only one in two (50 percent) in the survey want a grand coalition by the next regular parliamentary election in three years, 41 percent want a re-election.</seg>
<seg id="20">Even in another survey published on Saturday clear losses in approval for Merkel were noted.</seg>
<seg id="21">Divided was also the assessment of Germans concerning whether in December Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the case of the unionists, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.</seg>

<seg id="2">There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.</seg>
<seg id="3">Silently, the coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.</seg>
<seg id="4">All is history.</seg>
<seg id="5">Meanwhile, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almost got promoted past season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, I am very happy with the appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">We made tightened spaces and put pressure on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="9">That was something to be proud of, praised Fetsch his boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for passes to him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wolbeck had much more time of possession in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="13">And more opportunities</seg>
<seg id="14">But Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">It almost backfired when SCA’s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made two dangerous attacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.</seg>
<seg id="16">After halftime, VfL boldly took complete control.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thewes just barely failed with a shot from 18 meters.</seg>
<seg id="18">Schroer was too late in minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fetsch decided to freshen up the team on the left wing and put in Miles Geske.</seg>
<seg id="20">As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fouled player himself stepped up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be in set play situations.</seg>
<seg id="22">Westhues kicked the ball with his strong right and the goalie had to face the fact that he had failed: 1:0 (minute 71).</seg>
<seg id="23">With 20 minutes left on the clock, the game seemed to last forever.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally touched the ball in the box.</seg>
<seg id="25">Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jannis Schneider was not ready to miss this opportunity (minute 79).</seg>
<seg id="27">Wolbeck had to endure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and secure the winning goal in minute 87.</seg>
<seg id="28">That might have been overkill.</seg>
<seg id="29">VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes</seg>

<seg id="2">Only 8 percent of board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Monday by the AllBright Foundation, an advance copy of which had been made available to the German Press Agency.</seg>
<seg id="3">The companies will have to make changes, otherwise international competitors will leave them behind, said foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the US, UK, or Sweden, male-only management teams have - with a few exceptions - been unthinkable for some time.</seg>
<seg id="5">The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative, and future-oriented by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a different corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">The slight increase in the number of women in German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies in the mid-cap index (MDax).</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of boards are female.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the previous year the value was still at 3.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most recently, there were 26 women working on the boards.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am sure that Dax companies will be recruiting women more consistently in the coming year - it is in their own best interest, said Ankersen.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement showed no commitment to increase the “zero percent” to date.</seg>
<seg id="14">The supervisory boards paint a different picture: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">If multiple women were recruited to the boards every year, a percentage of 40 percent would be achieved in 2023, it says in the report.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manchester United loses again, Mourinho’s situation is becoming uncomfortable</seg>
<seg id="2">After the embarassing exit from the League Cup Manchester United now receives a loss in the 7th round of the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="3">Against West Ham United ManU looses 1:3. The way of defeat certainly will remain a matter of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">The scene in the 74th minute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3:1, was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford appeared to bring the Red Devils back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the team suspected an offside in the pass by Mark Nobel, all of Manchester’s defensive players froze in position, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was the negative climax of a very inadequate performance over long stretches.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mood of United’s city rival, Manchester City is quite different.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Citizens coached by Mourinho’s big rival Pep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unchallenged 2:0 win.</seg>
<seg id="9">After half an hour Raheem Sterling made the first breakthrough, through the defense of the outsiders, for the home team.</seg>
<seg id="10">After a good hour Sergio Agüero secured the way for the sixth win in seven game, through a double pass of the previous goal scorer, which sprung the team to the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="11">Liverpool is no longer table leader</seg>
<seg id="12">Three days after losing 1:2 at the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 with Liverpool against Chelsea in the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="13">As at the Cup exit the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the London team.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute was the only goal of match until the final phase.</seg>
<seg id="15">Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute only closely missed the tie goal after 70 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his curl.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, the London team eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the League, the Blues removed Liverpool now also from the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="19">Like City, the two London clubs celebrated 2:0 wins against Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford).</seg>
<seg id="20">The fans of the Gunners, under whose eyes Granit Xhaka played, against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, had to wait until the 81st minute wait for a success message.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nine minutes before the end of the game the Watford defender Craig Cathcart unleashed a cross-field ball past Alex Iwobi into one’s own net. Only two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season which was decisive.</seg>
<seg id="22">Arsenal passed Watford thanks to its fifth successive win and are now fifth, just behind the great rivals Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to leave a strong impression as a team climbing in position under the Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row in the League with a 2:0 win over Southampton which places them in the eighth place.</seg>

<seg id="3">Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="9">Starting from 10 am, the heavy bikes lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.</seg>

<seg id="2">And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.</seg>
<seg id="3">She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big amount of interest.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the life of an apple to his astonished spectators step by step from the ripe apple to apple juice.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to fill the apples in the big funnel.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink was to be made from it.</seg>
<seg id="9">But they could even witness this important step on the late Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which looked a bit like chopped shreds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thanks to certain technical support, the last work step was now no longer so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="12">The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a big vessel.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the Füchtorf farmer also had bottled specialties with him.</seg>
<seg id="14">So he opened his “treasure chest” and presented the latest Federweisser [alcoholic beverage] to the older visitors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was a lot of demand for the good “Made in Füchtorf” beverage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents got to talking while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up.</seg>
<seg id="17">Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited people to join in fun games at several stations.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Home Association will also offer an action day next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover facing fourth washout this season: "Shitty situation"</seg>
<seg id="2">Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, there were not many positives to take away from the bottom team’s earlier 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a crappy situation, but you have to come out on the other side as a team, said 96 player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This is of course disappointing, because you always try for the best result possible".</seg>
<seg id="5">Victory continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored to narrow the gap. They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and must be considered a relegation candidate in their current form.</seg>
<seg id="6">By contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of the season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middle of the table on seven points.</seg>
<seg id="8">Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move by the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hannover’s defense struggled to reign him in.</seg>
<seg id="9">The striker battered after the World Cup, showed by his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.</seg>
<seg id="10">Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was called up to Frankfurt’s starting eleven for the first time and the team got off to a dynamic start.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first sign of danger came in the form of Lucas Torró’s header (17th), which was deflected into the netting.</seg>
<seg id="12">Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped by 96’s defense in a promising position. The defenders were led by the Brazilian Felipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injury.</seg>
<seg id="13">The home side’s lead was all but inevitable and completely justified.</seg>
<seg id="14">After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to tap it in.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had joined the club during the summer.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Frankfurt increased the tally before the break.</seg>
<seg id="17">This time, Haller passed to his fellow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.</seg>
<seg id="18">At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the end of the match when they at least managed to score and narrow the gap.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Hessians were much more efficient.</seg>
<seg id="21">After just under an hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who just tapped the ball into the empty goal.</seg>
<seg id="22">Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy for the rest of the match, which also saw Jovic scoring with one minute to go.</seg>

<seg id="2">Catholics in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or on the Sunday after.</seg>
<seg id="3">The festival service takes place at the town church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the blessing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Church of the Holy Cross lies Christus, who witnessed the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.</seg>
<seg id="6">This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Christus' resting place, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction is not finished yet, only the sanctuary is, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inspite of the importance for the Geising parish, attendance was rather poor.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing concluded the ecclesiastical part of the cross festival.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home for many years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a big selection of cakes and, appropriate for the weather, farm-fresh ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which will last until next year.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare more concretely.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the already existing damage hase worsended over the last few years, but also more damaged has been uncovered, which was only possible through the inspection by means of the scaffold.</seg>
<seg id="16">The plinth plastering work is completed and before the winter, the natural stone work will begin and the involved parties hope to finish about half of this work this year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Donau-Iller life aid is opening a new hostel for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.</seg>
<seg id="3">All those attending the ceremony agreed that "a very special house" is now opening its doors for its intended purpose.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home provided by Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on its unique architecture.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wider aisles, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have all been part of architect Rudolf Bader’s concept.</seg>
<seg id="6">Planning first began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officers’building was tested for its suitability for residents with disabilities: "The house was getting old and no longer up-to-date in terms of features," Bader explained looking back.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 2016, excavators started rolling to demolish the house.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new building was to be designed to be as welcoming and bright as possible, so that the residents could feel comfortable in it, says the architect.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential home</seg>
<seg id="10">The life aid invested approximately 4.6 million euro in the new construction.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state of Bavaria contributed 2.4 million Euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financially.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Lebenshilfe’s managing director Jürgen Heinz thanked Bader this accomplishment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The balance between a barrier-free and fireproof design has not always been easy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, the planners and handymen built a home with many specifications, to allow residents the freedom to move even without outside help.</seg>
<seg id="16">The same was expressed by the head of social services in the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘The home is geared towards the special requirements of its residents, who need help with mobility’.</seg>
<seg id="17">Comfort and functionality have been combined to good effect in the process, said Kreutmayer.</seg>
<seg id="18">And also: ‘The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it no longer needs to be acquired in today’s situation’.</seg>
<seg id="19">All in all, the new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are paid union wages.</seg>

<seg id="1">A new week, a new opportunity for the government</seg>
<seg id="2">Back to regulatory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke the mantra "return to work".</seg>
<seg id="4">That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference really is between work and paperwork, but that's all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the federal government is ready to devote itself again to the task of governing, they should not be distracted from this now with debates on terminology.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether Union and SPD can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of recent weeks, will possibly be seen on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leaders of the governing parties will come together for the coalition committee in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to summon this session regularly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons can be learned from all the disputes.</seg>
<seg id="9">First of all, however, conflict-laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.</seg>
<seg id="10">CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.</seg>
<seg id="11">While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration law.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD promotes a long-term perspective for failed asylum-seekers, who work or who are training.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum system into the labor market.</seg>
<seg id="14">There will be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="15">Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dispute is good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without dispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.</seg>
<seg id="18">But to be constructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of being or not-being.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is about politics, not theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">Union and SPD are to argue - but must always have the reality of life of the people in view.</seg>

<seg id="1">Colored powder and eggs: Protests in Barcelona before the Catalonia’s anniversary</seg>
<seg id="2">The controversial independence referendum took place on Monday in Catalonia.</seg>
<seg id="3">But right before it begun the protests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The autumn 2017 police operation was not forgotten by the separatists.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, in the downtown of Barcelona separatists clashed with police.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among other things Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with colored powder, as they were trying to prevent them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the demonstration about 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illegal referendum.</seg>
<seg id="8">An attempt to prevent citizens from voting lead to violence.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Spanish media reported that the Catalan police formed a chain to keep the separatists and central security forces apart.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, some of the about 6000 separatists tried to break the police chain by force, and were throwing at officials, among other things, paint bombs and eggs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Citing the authorities it was said that six people had been arrested and 24 other were slightly injured.</seg>
<seg id="12">The independence referendum took place for the first time on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the vote and subsequent decision to split off the prosperous region from Spain, in autumn 2017 the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under control.</seg>
<seg id="14">The former regional president Carles Puigdemont has fled to Belgium.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other politicians also escaped abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, several ministers of then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.</seg>
<seg id="17">In December in the region were held new elections.</seg>
<seg id="18">After the new Catalan government's inauguration in May, the forced administration was terminated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yet the new president insists on the ‘Right of self-determination’ of Catalans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen</seg>
<seg id="2">Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="3">FC Gütersloh only didn’t get further than a 0-0 draw.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first half was rather dim in terms of entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or bratwurst could do it without worrying they would miss anything.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was no risk of missing a goal opportunity, because there were virtually none.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first shot on goal happened after half an hour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh’s Nick Flock in minute 28.</seg>
<seg id="10">The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 32.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hosts were even more harmless.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their most effective action was an early substitution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury. Sinan Aygün replaced him.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the substitution, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.</seg>
<seg id="15">In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.</seg>
<seg id="16">After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quickly dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nick Flock (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, they went one better with a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a corner from former Ahlen player Tim Manstein.</seg>
<seg id="19">RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little later Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).</seg>
<seg id="20">That lead to nothing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The team from Ahlen did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but that did not get them anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="23">Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we kept a clean sheet." But unfortunately, both sides scored zero.</seg>
<seg id="24">We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as against Holzwickede, even though our opponents did not want to play here, states RW Ahlen’s interim coach.</seg>
<seg id="25">Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team that "just wanted to defend.</seg>
<seg id="26">At any rate, I did not feel that we could concede a goal," said Daut.</seg>
<seg id="27">To his chagrin, however, the viewer did not feel like his team could score a goal, either.</seg>
<seg id="28">The performance was too poor for that.</seg>

<seg id="2">That is good news for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these donations are intended.</seg>
<seg id="3">The volunteers clarify: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the opening the sky was a brilliant blue, but the square was a little empty, which was to change over the day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because: "It is such a friendly atmosphere, that is why we are here today," said one visitor.</seg>

<seg id="10">And the "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the ever increasing number of visitors.</seg>

<seg id="16">Andreas Hajek praised everybody’s engagement, in the stands, and also included the additional festivals that took place in September and the ‘clean-up’ action.</seg>
<seg id="17">Our garden city is getting a colorful coat of paint - things are really happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">Next, the wreath was taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken into winter storage.</seg>

<seg id="23">Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The latter has another specialty on hand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Gingerbread in a glass, with honey from my own production of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">Little Elsa kept coming back for seconds, that is how good the cake was.</seg>

<seg id="1">Graffiti with a local political message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate park</seg>
<seg id="2">In Lengerich, unknown people have advocated for the construction of a skate park in a hardly beneficial way.</seg>
<seg id="3">In several places, there are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on the request of the WN.</seg>
<seg id="4">In at least one case, a criminal complaint for property damage has been filed with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed in large letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that writing was found on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the career choice fair.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the short message was apparently "only" made with a marker, it could easily be removed.</seg>
<seg id="8">A few days later, it was there again, but this time it was sprayed on, says Rottmann.</seg>
<seg id="9">He assumes that the respective advertising sign has to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="10">This case is special by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the board.</seg>
<seg id="11">If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without naming names.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the graffitied board.</seg>
<seg id="14">For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of a skate park.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the old had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began.</seg>
<seg id="16">The council finally chose the fire department parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, this request was not implemented - apparently, too many factors were against a construction at this point.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the end of June, it was all turned around again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg school.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regarding the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.</seg>
<seg id="21">Then, city council has the last word.</seg>
<seg id="22">He assumes a decision will be reached this year, so that park can be built in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bottlenecks in air traffic control are getting even worse</seg>
<seg id="2">Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffic in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="3">This year it was only wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit after that, head of the German air traffic union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the well known staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix to this problem.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five years, the unionist said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that there are hardly any fully trained air traffic controllers available on the European market.</seg>
<seg id="7">He pointed out that the Karlsruhe center monitoring Germany’s upper air space alone is short of some one hundred staff.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maas again criticized the fact that different air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Representatives from federal and state governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, that will not work without us, said the head of the German air traffic union, many members of which work for the federally owned German air traffic control company DFS.</seg>
<seg id="11">Maas again held the EU Commission’s guidelines responsible for the air traffic control predicament.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asserted that traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 had been far too low.</seg>
<seg id="13">The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services now have a severe impact on daily operations, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulations in Brussels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxygen".</seg>
<seg id="15">He cautioned that, as things stand, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Maas, the EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they have sown in recent years, said Maas.</seg>
<seg id="18">He hopes that the high costs incurred by the airlines as a result of delays will lead them to think again.</seg>
<seg id="19">The German air traffic union would work to improve the situation only if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented training and education," said Maas.</seg>
<seg id="20">He further noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related personnel reductions.</seg>
<seg id="21">It does not yet address the necessary staff expansion.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence activists demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Catalan police tried to keep the two protesting groups away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to deployment forces, advocates for independence again tried to break through the security barrier.</seg>

<seg id="9">The police stated there have been six arrests.</seg>
<seg id="10">Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues</seg>
<seg id="11">The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central government.</seg>
<seg id="12">They demanded better salaries at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much more than they were.</seg>
<seg id="14">The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.</seg>
<seg id="15">Why did they come here to protest? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simply to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who said his name is Daniel, rejected the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course we want to support our comrades who were only doing their job a year ago: defending the law, he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the demonstration is here to enforce our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona, because it is a major European city and there is more echo here.</seg>

<seg id="1">Football: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo’s best game</seg>
<seg id="2">The Portuguese star striker ‘this evening played the best game in addition to Valencia’s half hour’, commended Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Napoli.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the coach, the expensively purchased star without scoring himself was the decisive man of the match in the important game against the pursuers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well, said Allegri.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal and we just got better from then onwards.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thanks to Ronaldo’s three assists, Juve struck back in the game after being down early through the goal by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) and in the thick of things the pursuer was put off for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="7">The goal-getter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double score (26./49.) for the lead.</seg>
<seg id="8">And Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for the goal by the defence leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to make a short push in, in front of the goal line.</seg>
<seg id="9">He gives a lot, said the trainer.</seg>
<seg id="10">But naturally Allegri will also see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to get better at serving him, the coach said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently Mandzukic is the best Juve scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has three.</seg>
<seg id="13">The superiority of Juventus seems even more overwhelming, with the purchase of Ronaldo, for more than 100 million Euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Series A. With 21 points the masters over the past seven years already have a six-point lead over Napoli.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second team in the table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.</seg>
<seg id="16">The top match was however decided at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.).</seg>
<seg id="17">The Portuguese after a too strong pile in against Paulo Dybala had to leave the field with a yellow-red.</seg>
<seg id="18">We played well against a good Napoli, the Turin coach commented.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emre Can should also feel addressed.</seg>
<seg id="20">The German national has asserted himself at Juve.</seg>
<seg id="21">The professional, who came from Liverpool, participated in all seven league matches.</seg>
<seg id="22">The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by the ‘half hour’: Ronaldo was sent off at the 2:0 Turin win and is barred for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.</seg>

<seg id="6">With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">That was by far our best performance of the season, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was phenomenal how we come back from the 0-2 draw and held up against one of the league's top teams over the entire match.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence, the more bitter it seems, that they had to go home empty-handed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Top scorer Lars Zymner shot his team in the lead with his 12th. Goal this season (minute 24).</seg>
<seg id="11">He needed exactly two touches in this game for this goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 2-0, he set for Fabian Fröhning (minute 39).</seg>
<seg id="13">We knew it, but you just can't completely take out a player like that.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was amazing what he did, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized the opponent’s quality.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just before switching sides, his own team managed to score the equalizer: McGill’s free kick from the left side sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).</seg>
<seg id="16">After switching sides, it was McGill again who scored the equalizer (59th minute).</seg>
<seg id="17">And then it went back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was a crisp, action-packed game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nübel shocked Albachten (minute 64), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized again (minute 69).</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite their numerical advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (minute 80).</seg>
<seg id="21">Now, we must focus on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="22">The game against Schapdetten, that’s one we have to win now, said Lewandowski.</seg>
<seg id="23">Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th minute Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th minute Bareksai).</seg>
<seg id="24">Goals: 1-0 Zymner (minute 24), 2-0 Fröhning (minute 39), 2-1 McGill (minute 45), 2-2 McGill (minute 59), 3-2 Nübel (minute 64), 3-3 P. Horstmann (minute 69), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (minute 80).</seg>
<seg id="25">Indirect Red: Atalan (minute 74/Albachten).</seg>

<seg id="2">Until the middle of the following year the Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has shown interest to personally claim the tolerance prize in Tutzing.</seg>

<seg id="6">This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have visited us". That celebrities appear again and again at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tina Teubner’s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for adults as well as men".</seg>
<seg id="3">Comedian Teubner honed in on gender communication with humor and empathy for the (stereotypical) woman and the (stereotypical) man - and anything else that out there - but also with music.</seg>
<seg id="4">They played mini guitar and also mastered their violins.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ben Süverkrüp was manning the piano.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congenially and in harmony, so much so that some may have wished a solo.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then there was this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, so as to fit the theme of the evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">Teubner had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man is happy when he has a partner but does not hold the door open for her.</seg>
<seg id="9">But that a closed door without a partner, on the other hand, offers no benefit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The piano solo demonstrated this very notion: How would Mozart’s career as a composer turned out, if his older sister "the Nannerl" had suddenly opened the door?</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach’s "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Death Rattle" Western theme, and from Mozart’s G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was great applause and shouts of "bravo" from the packed hall.</seg>
<seg id="13">The association’s treasurer, Karlheinz Kleintje, presented flowers to the singer.</seg>
<seg id="14">But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused to part without offering additional thanks.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had the idea to treat the duo to a gig in Wolbeck in addition to their appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have established themselves again in the top group of the 3. League West.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the home field of relegated club’s VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-white won with 3-1.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a huge step in a cool season.</seg>
<seg id="5">It’s so much fun to play in the upper third of the league.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is what we have been working towards, says trainer Dominik Münch excitedly after an almost flawless performance by his team at the now defeated table leader.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the first part, the guests dominated almost however they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="8">With 4-1, 16-10 and 22-12, the runner-up of the previous year won with a 25-15.</seg>
<seg id="9">Essen played with two lines, but has not come into play.</seg>
<seg id="10">We kept them on their toes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our opponent struck with a high risk, but also produced countless penalty cards.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the second set, the BSV already led with 12-8. "Essen changed to three lines.</seg>
<seg id="13">We could not hold the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="14">Essen moved in closer, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continued.</seg>
<seg id="15">At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were in front.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.</seg>
<seg id="17">The game was now in a better class, believes the trainer about the performance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maike Rüdingloh and then Wiebke Silge made huge contributions with their serves that BSV turned the page in the third set from 14:16 to 25:21.</seg>
<seg id="19">Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."</seg>
<seg id="20">At 7-3 and 15-13, the blue-white added part four with 25:22 to their side.</seg>

<seg id="3">On October 18th (Thursday) at 19:30, the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the old Amtmannei.</seg>
<seg id="4">It’s almost exactly a year to the day since we met here for a Folk Festival for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">This event has now become a fixture in the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Home Association, pleased.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would not have thought that our Folktreff got established so quickly in Nottuln.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whether it was the storm Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the ‘Amtmannei’ was always full.</seg>
<seg id="8">As always, the program for the next Folk Festival is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, evergreens an old hits, says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always inviting musical friends to Nottuln.</seg>
<seg id="9">Klaus Spellmeyer has promised to play his accordion for the first Folk Festival “birthday.”</seg>

<seg id="11">Now he's a member of an Irish folk band.</seg>
<seg id="12">The creators of the Folk Festival fondly remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schultz from the Folk Festival Emsdetten excited the audience with his international version of the song “Frogs in the Night” and sent them home with the song stuck in their heads.</seg>
<seg id="13">We are expecting many happy guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening together, says the invitation from the Home Association.</seg>
<seg id="14">Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join in.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the coveted seats are always taken quickly, it’s recommended to get there early enough.</seg>

<seg id="1">From clean fruit to ecology</seg>
<seg id="2">The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation was celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.</seg>
<seg id="3">On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebrated the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).</seg>
<seg id="4">Frankly the association had a different name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach City and Country).</seg>
<seg id="5">The purpose of the fruit-growing association differed from that of today’s work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite, explained the local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fruit trees lined the highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.</seg>
<seg id="8">Today fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.</seg>
<seg id="9">But by far that is not the end of the scope.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gardening close to nature, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge about healthy diets and youth work.</seg>
<seg id="11">The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.</seg>
<seg id="12">Youth work is critically important, especially in the digital age, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised how important experiences in nature are for life.</seg>
<seg id="13">Collecting chestnuts was for us as children a huge thing, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner .</seg>
<seg id="15">Where the trees will be planted will be decided by the district association, added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.</seg>
<seg id="16">The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, was also stated without doubt by the county manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.</seg>
<seg id="18">He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about the long history of the district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the war.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter conserves were made.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the end of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live-in garden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nature endures, it existed before us and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded the specialist in fruit and nut trees.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is an incentive therefore for the gardening associations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful and worth living.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associations, explained the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.</seg>
<seg id="24">We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was festively framed by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau music association.</seg>

<seg id="2">Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has been released from the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to his hometown Río de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will attend any events in the last week before the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="5">The politician had been attacked on the street in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the title "Ele não" (English: "Not him"), especially women's associations protested against the ex-military.</seg>
<seg id="8">The associations also took to social media to protest against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic hub São Paulo.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the capital of Brasilia, protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.</seg>
<seg id="11">He took the position of former president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="12">The presidential election in Brazil will be on October 7.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the former mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro according to polls.</seg>

<seg id="1">Following a long illness: Danish rock legend died</seg>
<seg id="2">The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.</seg>
<seg id="3">The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 following a long illness, shared his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen’s website.</seg>
<seg id="4">Larsen was surrounded on his deathbed by his wife and six children.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since the beginning of the year the musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="6">Larsen became famous with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandinavia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their songs were influenced by music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1978, after the dissolution of the band, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.</seg>
<seg id="9">He sold about three million records in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="10">His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone’s hearts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of government also recalled that in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Larsen performed on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.</seg>

<seg id="1">A night of rock in the shoe factory: Loud as a jackhammer</seg>
<seg id="2">Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a tiger. The band names Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music event on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the community center housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who are also friends.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians take time for a group photo.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no hint of stage fright in the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">Afterwards, the lead singers and their bands from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - visibly enthrall the approximately 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito rock night with their loud performances.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kicking things off, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pieces, which the band penned themselves for their soon to be released CD.</seg>
<seg id="7">In front of the stage, people dance to the powerful yet harmonious band performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite loud calls for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw then hand over the reigns to the three-member Here We Stand.</seg>
<seg id="9">Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard rock with their alternative sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.</seg>
<seg id="10">Following the high energy rock of the Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on top of the guitar sound.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among other titles, the yearning, almost ballad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by switching between melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of the multi-layered songs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation since the band formed in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="13">The band presented their full-energy hard rock on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour.</seg>
<seg id="15">Playing off his band, Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann has his very own take on the evening’s only cover - Word Up by Cameo from the 80s.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, it feels like the volume is dialed up even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a solo while running through the cheering crowd.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of course, when it comes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibel level has to be expected: According to the sound crew, that level was around 98 decibels for the three band concert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito night of rock.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is approximately the same level as a jackhammer, which is still significantly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festival referenced on the band website of The Ignition.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the Ahlen audience has no need during this night of rock for 120 decibel sound as loud as a jet engine, as is common at the heavy metal get together in the north of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">After just under four hours, the three hard rock bands have long since won the audience over with their confident, expert performance and own songs.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the end, all three bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the strength of a tiger."</seg>
<seg id="22">Above all, they enjoyed the plentiful applause from the audience.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is no secret that the US President is well disposed towards North Korea’s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is also linked to Kim’s ‘wonderful letters’.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the tender age of 72 years, the married US president has a new flame.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tragic thing is: It is a long-distance relationship.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Saturday, in total public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</seg>
<seg id="8">Supporters in the US federal state of West Virginia have heard tender words from Trump for the descendant from the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang half his age, although the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a particularly tough job.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was tough and so was he, it went backwards and forwards between us, reported Trump.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we fell in love.</seg>
<seg id="11">OK?</seg>
<seg id="12">No, really.</seg>
<seg id="13">And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.</seg>
<seg id="14">He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their personal connection also bore fruit politically: Trump pointed to Kim’s announced to halt all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics say it is mere cheap talk.</seg>
<seg id="16">The US president seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fond of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump’s nickname for Kim.</seg>
<seg id="17">He accepted the expected criticism during his appearance at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘Donald Trump says, they have fallen in love’.</seg>
<seg id="18">How terrible, how terrible is this?</seg>
<seg id="19">That is so unpresidential.</seg>
<seg id="20">He cared little for that, said Trump, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be presidential."</seg>

<seg id="2">Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya which has made it possible for them to be rescued.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the risk of their lives, the group had shot the video in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.</seg>
<seg id="4">They refuse to send us back, said a man in the video message.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are suffering here. We are dying here.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recording was sent to the website “France 24 Observers,” whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).</seg>
<seg id="7">The refugees were ultimately flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.</seg>
<seg id="8">Without the video, we likely would not have been able to return to Nigeria, said Efe Onyeka, who made the video, according to the news agency AFP.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 25-year old was arrested in Libya when attempting to make her way into Europe via the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="10">With the video, he said he risked his own life.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of his companions was almost beaten to death by guards, said Onyeka.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the conditions in jail were catastrophic; “They beat all of us with pipes and sticks.”</seg>
<seg id="13">They didn't give us anything to eat. We had to drink out of the latrine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The IOM organized the voluntary repatriation of the refugees who were stranded in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="15">About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home in the West African country this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the poor conditions in Libya, this case of the now rescued Nigerians is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, a call for help via mobile phone video was new to them.</seg>
<seg id="18">International organizations are criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.</seg>

<seg id="5">He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that "if in the future relations are going to become normal and if economic relations are going to deepen, then the rule of law is a very important condition."</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans being imprisoned in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="7">He had expressed the hope that freedom of expression would be respected.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thereupon Erdogan once again underlined the independence of Turkish system of justice.</seg>

<seg id="3">Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="4">North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the UN General Debate, has accused the US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The recent standstill has seen the US implementing coercive measures, which are lethal to trust-building, said Ri in New York.</seg>
<seg id="6">Disarmament under these circumstance would be unthinkable for North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without any trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves first, the North Korean head diplomat said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea that North Korea could be ‘brought to its knees’ due to the sanctions, is ‘a pipe dream of people who don’t know us’.</seg>
<seg id="9">To build trust his country has stopped its atom and missile tests and has destroyed a nuclear test system, Ri said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the USA has shown no "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister criticised.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year alone, because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Concurrently, the US government is working on a rapprochement.</seg>

<seg id="15">After the first summit in Singapore the US President is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fall of Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bayern calls for Ajax</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of unbeatable is gone: The defeat in Berlin will not allow the FC Bayern to give up.</seg>
<seg id="3">The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the interim conclusion for Niko Kovac’s tenure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under no circumstances should the first small drop in power with the new coach Niko Kovaca should increase for Munich to the autumn minimum.</seg>
<seg id="5">A week ago, everyone still thought we were unbeatable.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now we are overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and asks for a return leg in the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Anyone who knows us, is aware that we are really angry and that is why we will crank up on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no goals, as at the same time two mandatory preseason games in series without a victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.</seg>
<seg id="9">The overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the champions shall be aware.</seg>
<seg id="10">The FC Augsburg with the 1:1 ratio having its long running man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through its playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered within two days two similar blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those who know Bayern are aware that we will not put up with that and that we will do everything to become successful again, Kovac said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native city with his losers and put his first defeat as Munich coach down to the inadequate handling of opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="13">A win over Amsterdam and Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">So before the second premier class appearance in this season after the 2-0 over Benfica Lisbon, Kovac undertook no extraordinary measures.</seg>
<seg id="15">As it was planned, after the day off on Sunday started quick preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now they’ve scored a victory over us in two games, but we will also reach our goals again, announced captain of the national team Manuel Neuer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kimmich.</seg>
<seg id="18">The right defender take on the role of admonisher.</seg>
<seg id="19">I do not believe that this is all bad luck, we need to work it out again, because we do not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the seventh match day of the previous season Bayern was even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over with one point ahead.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, that now the public debate about supposedly invincible Bavaria has ended.</seg>
<seg id="22">Yes, that’s good, said the national player.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a good thing for the league.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Turkish president Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany amidst serious accusations.</seg>
<seg id="3">The DFB president Grindel admits mistakes but upholds the association’s line.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now will be created a new post.</seg>
<seg id="5">Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the Turkish President criticized the speech of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of DFB upheld the association’s line.</seg>
<seg id="7">Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, who had been personally attacked by Özil, reported on the consequences of the issue on the Mainz ZDF “Sport studio”.</seg>
<seg id="8">As we have a lot of players with a migration background in the U teams, in future we must draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this does not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player without a migration background as an additional integration official.</seg>
<seg id="9">Grindel also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latter was very critical of the racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.</seg>
<seg id="12">They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed with them in England," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact that our two young men, who had been risen to the German national team, were excluded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, after the World Cup affair, which had been taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt that he was "reasonably treated by the DFB".</seg>
<seg id="15">He also said he wanted to stand up for players in future.</seg>
<seg id="16">That thing they say: If I win - I’m German, if I lose - I’m a migrant - that will not work.</seg>
<seg id="17">I am very sorry that he had such an impression, said Grindel.</seg>
<seg id="18">I’ve always said that we had to defend Mesut more.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yet he does not see grounds for Özil to return to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an additional integration representative.</seg>
<seg id="21">If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says: The issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB President again next year.</seg>
<seg id="23">I do my work and take care I do it as well as possible, Grindel said.</seg>

<seg id="6">On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last week, the state of emergency was lifted, which had been proclaimed a week earlier on September 21th, because it had been feared that the flames would spread by wind and flying sparks and thus endanger adjacent forests and settlements.</seg>
<seg id="8">On thursday, it was reported that there is no longer a threat of the fire spreading to adjacent communities.</seg>
<seg id="9">At times more than 1,500 deployment forces on site attempted to get the big fire under control.</seg>
<seg id="10">The German Air Force used a transport helicopter to support the work on the German Federal Armed Forces test site near Meppen.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are also reconnaissance flights with the Bundeswehr's drones.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the German Federal Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with “Tornadoes” are again planned for October 2 and 5.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fire was caused by test rockets, which the Airbus technicians had fired off.</seg>
<seg id="14">The smoke draught of the moorland fires went up to a hundred kilometers far, even farther than the northwest of Germany, up to Bremen at times.</seg>

<seg id="4">(dpa) Switzerland starts its electronic register for organ donation this Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">This should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those who want to donate their organs in cases of death, can register themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">Your wishes will then be available to Swisstransplant, if required.</seg>
<seg id="8">Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent, as is the case in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have donor cards, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant foundation.</seg>
<seg id="10">But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment when donating is possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">In over 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the dead person’s intentions.</seg>
<seg id="12">You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, according to their wish, which is often very stressful, says Immer.</seg>
<seg id="13">A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Germany, the recording of details about possible organ donation on the health card has been considered, as stated by the speaker for the Federal Office for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.</seg>

<seg id="1">On Monday farmers are allowed to start the annual hedge bank maintainance</seg>
<seg id="2">On Monday Schleswig-Holstein farmers can start with the annual hedge bank maintainance.</seg>
<seg id="3">For around 200 years, the "green ramparts" which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘forest replacements’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas of retreat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hedge banks are living fences</seg>
<seg id="7">In the year 1766 the hedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ‘living fences’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fencing, they also provided farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.</seg>
<seg id="9">From that time comes the name "Knick": By "bending over" (Umknicken) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, around 45 000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the NABU’s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habitat.</seg>
<seg id="12">One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there.</seg>

<seg id="1">After the tsunami on Sulawesi an Indonesian talks about local situation</seg>
<seg id="2">The local Radika Pinto describes the local situation on Sulawesi island following the earthquakes and tsunami in the interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND):</seg>
<seg id="3">Were you on location when the tsunami took place?</seg>
<seg id="4">No, I was in Jakarta on Java island at the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the time of the earthquakes, my wife called me, she was in Palu.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="7">I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive for more than 20 hours by car after the flight as the airport at Palu was closed at the time.</seg>
<seg id="8">What is the situation on the island now?</seg>
<seg id="9">The national government has opened the airport again, so aid supply can be flown in.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which were completely destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our ‘World Vision’ office is also destroyed, but we have set something up provisionally, where other people have also been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="12">Where are the people of Sulawesi living now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they held out through fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where there is no access to water and food.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many stopped in front of their houses with aftershocks still being experienced.</seg>
<seg id="15">As many food shops and gas stations are completely shut, some people are stealing provisions and gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="16">The public services have completely shut down and the national government is helping.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and searching for them is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are still lots of bodies lying around, many people have not been found and are missing.</seg>
<seg id="19">How is the communication and information flow on the island?</seg>
<seg id="20">At the moment we have mobile reception, which did not work previously and we have been receiving information via radio.</seg>
<seg id="21">Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other persons, not knowing if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquake and were on the way to work, for example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tsunami warning system did not work correctly.</seg>
<seg id="23">Do you have any information about this?</seg>
<seg id="24">We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear was given, many people thought ‘OK, no tsunami’, and then it came.</seg>
<seg id="25">In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was false information about a tsunami hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding hills.</seg>
<seg id="26">An island like Sulawesi that sits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared for earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.</seg>
<seg id="28">We normally know how to react to an earthquake and are trained for evacuations.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.</seg>

<seg id="2">Time is extremely tight and the number of planned interrogations is very restricted.</seg>
<seg id="3">Republicans in the US Senate want the break-neck speed FBI investigation to help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clarify more than 30 years of suspected incidents from years back.</seg>
<seg id="5">The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination, which has involved a culture war, had been triggered on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">After an 8-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer directed angry tirades at the opposition democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to pave the way for final confirmation of the ultra-sensitive judge at the US Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake, against his original announcement, suddenly declared he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Following tumultuous scenes his party friends agreed.</seg>
<seg id="9">President Trump, who described the bitter arguments on Thursday as a ‘scam’, then included further attacks against the women and spoke in contrast about a ‘blessing in disguise’.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said that this way any lingering doubts could be eliminated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a great sense of relief at Schalke after the first win of the season.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, time was also a factor against Mainz.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Heidel is well-known for being a huge pessimist at football matches.</seg>
<seg id="6">The home game against Mainz 05 was no different.</seg>
<seg id="7">I saw every ball going in.</seg>
<seg id="8">And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="9">After all, the "royal blues" had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the course of the match and thus celebrated the first victory of the season.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, things could have been very different.</seg>
<seg id="11">After Alessandro Schöpf (11th) had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and therefore security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both in terms of how we played and in terms of pressing". As the match continued, mental strength became increasingly important.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schöpf is usually not an aerial threat</seg>
<seg id="13">The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me, said Heidel: ‘I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench’.</seg>
<seg id="14">The boys were afraid to squander the lead and therefore kept retreating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And threw everything they had into our defense.</seg>
<seg id="16">To hold on to the first three points of the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am actually the worst header on the team."</seg>
<seg id="18">But in the end, victory is all that counts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The relief was felt throughout the entire arena, not least by Tedesco.</seg>
<seg id="20">We wanted to start strong in the early stages and make a firework of it, said Schalke’s head coach.</seg>
<seg id="21">The win was an important one.</seg>
<seg id="22">Finally we can enjoy ourselves for a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="23">I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.</seg>
<seg id="24">We played smart, calmly and with courage, that is how we must approach matches over 90 minutes</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: The "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish control over the match early.</seg>
<seg id="26">After all, they did get their chances, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).</seg>
<seg id="27">That way it would not have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Tedesco: "You really could feel the fear a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="28">So I am glad that we won.</seg>
<seg id="29">He was not the only one at Schalke.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani is standing before them.</seg>
<seg id="3">He has once again accepted the invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.</seg>
<seg id="4">For many year, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven, explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.</seg>
<seg id="5">El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.</seg>
<seg id="6">With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he introduces the audience to one of the most contentious topics: Migration and integration.</seg>
<seg id="7">Why are there increasingly conflicts, despite successful integration?</seg>
<seg id="8">The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.</seg>
<seg id="9">The German society sits at the big table, the migrants of the first generation at the kid’s table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.</seg>
<seg id="11">The third generation of migrants is born in Germany. They always sat at the big table and now want to have a say too.</seg>
<seg id="12">This leads to conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, it is not of importance whether one is politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="14">At first rather restrained, then the discussion round gets more and more lively.</seg>
<seg id="15">And there is a need for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="16">An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, and two teachers explain how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.</seg>
<seg id="17">El-Mafaalani stands in front of the stage, not on it, symbolizing the discussion: It is a discussion at eye level.</seg>
<seg id="18">The sociology professor does not force his opinion onto the audience, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.</seg>
<seg id="19">He is happy that people are interested in the topic, because “we can only find a solution once we understand what the problem is,” says El-Mafaalani.</seg>
<seg id="20">Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the guests’ questions and the discussion continued in the foyer over Kurdish specialties.</seg>

<seg id="2">The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in South Landsham.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Pliening community sold the first properties in the South Landsham development area on the open market.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was reported by the mayor Roland Frick.</seg>
<seg id="5">Anyway the application phase for each of the 20 properties, which the municipality is offering at better conditions and prices - similar to the earlier local model, has now ended.</seg>
<seg id="6">At least 100 applications have been received, says Frick.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, the documents are being reviewed with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal by the end of the year is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots of land ready for submission to the local council.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that the awarding of the plots can follow.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the area to the south of Landsham a total of 50 single-family and semi-detached properties will be created, including four areas for apartment blocks earmarked for eight residential units.</seg>
<seg id="11">The development is practically completed, only the streets and pathways now need to be asphalted.</seg>
<seg id="12">A single plot and two for apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.</seg>
<seg id="13">The municipality sells the bulk of the plots on the open market, 20 plots according to the socially responsible model.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two multi-family houses of the borough are to be built according to Frick as affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="15">With a total of 16 income-oriented flats subsidised by the Free State.</seg>
<seg id="16">Room for 200 people</seg>
<seg id="17">Roughly estimated, there will be space for about 200 people within the properties of the developing area of Landsham-Süd.</seg>

<seg id="4">But when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 in the center circle as usual and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his players, the 36-year-old nicknamed Naldo stepped in and said; "We have to thank, coach!"</seg>

<seg id="6">Naldo, who was awarded best Schalke player last season, probably knows that he is actually not going to be stuck on the bench - he does have a good reason for this break.</seg>
<seg id="7">A reason called “load control.”</seg>
<seg id="8">It was not easy to tell him</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is an important player. He is an important person.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” said Tedesco as he justifies the step.</seg>
<seg id="12">Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is 36 years old.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is important that everyone can catch their breath at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The purchasing managers index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.</seg>
<seg id="3">Across Europe, however, Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe after Ireland and the Netherlands, stated the Markit Institute on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.</seg>

<seg id="7">In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fell more slowly than in the previous months.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the slightly eased downswing could mean that the worst is over, said Markit economist Rob Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.</seg>
<seg id="11">A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders to the eurozone have not fallen this much since November 2011.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is why companies have cut back jobs for the seventh month in a row.</seg>
