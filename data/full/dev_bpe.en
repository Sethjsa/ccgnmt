Jennifer Ani@@ st@@ on@@ : I@@ '@@ m always pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ed
Jennifer Ani@@ ston need not always be perfect or success@@ ful@@ .
That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an inter@@ vie@@ w.

Jennifer Ani@@ ston (@@ 47@@ ) can only laugh that she has been dubbed "@@ Miss Per@@ fec@@ t@@ " in the current issue of "@@ Cosmo@@ poli@@ tan@@ "@@ .
The actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the television with her hair in a relaxed bun@@ , eating Mexican food@@ , the magazine re@@ por@@ ts@@ .

Golfer Lan@@ ger is awarded the Sport Py@@ ramid
His experience on horseback is negli@@ gi@@ ble@@ .
At the end of a golfing tournament in South Afri@@ ca@@ , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a bit of fun@@ .
It was a first for the 58@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ d.
CH@@ IO@@ : "@@ Golden Sport Py@@ ra@@ mid@@ " for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
After a few min@@ ut@@ es@@ , the horse decided it wanted to go home@@ , and ra@@ ced back to its feeding trough at full til@@ t.
After a kilometre at this speed I was sc@@ are@@ d.
"@@ It was@@ n@@ '@@ t a good experi@@ ence@@ ,@@ " said Lan@@ ger@@ .
And with th@@ at@@ , his riding career came to an end aga@@ in@@ .
On Satur@@ day@@ , German@@ y@@ '@@ s best gol@@ fer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near hor@@ ses@@ .
He and his family tou@@ red the AL@@ R@@ V ground@@ s@@ , but he did not jump onto a horse for a phot@@ o.
It was Lan@@ ger@@ '@@ s first time in A@@ ach@@ en@@ , and at CH@@ IO@@ .
He had been thoroughly convinc@@ ed@@ .
The German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from An@@ hausen with the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid at a small gala event@@ .
The friendly sports@@ man is not lacking for awar@@ d@@ s.
The Federal Cross of Mer@@ it@@ , the Silver Lau@@ rel Le@@ af@@ , Champions Tour Player of the Y@@ ear@@ ...
Even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon hi@@ m.
Lan@@ ger is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyrami@@ d.
On Satur@@ day@@ , he met the first person to receive it@@ , Hans Günter Win@@ kler@@ , in A@@ ach@@ en@@ .
"@@ This award means a lot to me@@ ,@@ " said Lan@@ ger@@ , "@@ because it@@ '@@ s not just given for sporting success@@ , but also for social commit@@ ment@@ .@@ "
Lan@@ ger has been encouraging up@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ coming talent for year@@ s.
And in this v@@ ein@@ , he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros on straight awa@@ y@@ .
The two@@ -@@ time US master@@ '@@ s champion was inaugurated into the "@@ Hall of Fame for German Sport@@ " on Satur@@ day@@ , along with 15 other outstanding sport@@ spe@@ op@@ le@@ .
T@@ hose given the award include track athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mitt@@ , gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast Eber@@ hard Gi@@ en@@ ger@@ , fen@@ cers Corne@@ lia Han@@ isch@@ , Alexander Putsch and Ar@@ nd Sch@@ mitt@@ , ro@@ wer Peter@@ -@@ Michael Kol@@ be@@ , b@@ ob@@ -@@ s@@ leigh rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer@@ , ju@@ do player Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke@@ , show@@ -@@ jum@@ per Al@@ win Schock@@ em@@ öh@@ le@@ , and@@ , pos@@ thum@@ ous@@ ly@@ , hand@@ ball player Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich@@ .
Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Satur@@ day@@ .
After the official part@@ , the illustri@@ ous gathering wander@@ ed to the show@@ -@@ jumping sta@@ di@@ um@@ , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was under@@ way@@ .

Compar@@ ing Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s and Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s economic poli@@ ci@@ es@@ : It@@ '@@ s all about the money
Bot@@ h Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agre@@ e@@ ment@@ .
But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy poli@@ ci@@ es@@ , as well as on one fundamental issu@@ e.
There is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s and Hillary Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s economic poli@@ ci@@ es@@ .
This is the role of the state@@ .
If in doub@@ t@@ , Trump wants the state@@ '@@ s role to be min@@ or@@ , and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regul@@ ations@@ .
Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its de@@ ath@@ , he sa@@ ys@@ .
He would do things totally differ@@ ent@@ ly@@ , Trump sa@@ ys@@ .
He would repeal regul@@ ations@@ , and lead a wi@@ de@@ -@@ reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and compani@@ es@@ .
Conver@@ sel@@ y@@ , Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil@@ , giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so@@ .
This would increase taxes for the rich@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ .
Inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly@@ , they have similar views on infra@@ struc@@ ture@@ .
There has to be investment in infra@@ struc@@ ture@@ , Trump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ati@@ m.
The Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War@@ .
State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat poli@@ ci@@ es@@ , and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican part@@ y@@ , which is critical of the state@@ .
Con@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ , Trump could lead to discussions within the part@@ y@@ .
There are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate poli@@ ci@@ es@@ .
Trump wants to build coal@@ -@@ fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up@@ .
Dri@@ lling for oil should be permitted in protected are@@ as@@ , and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Tre@@ at@@ y@@ .
On the other hand@@ , Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies@@ , say@@ ing@@ : "@@ One country will become the superpower of renewable energies@@ , and create millions of job@@ s.@@ "
"@@ It will either be Chin@@ a@@ , Germany or America - and I want it to be us@@ .@@ "
But it@@ '@@ s not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well@@ .
N@@ either want to sign TT@@ P@@ , the trans@@ -@@ Pacific trade agre@@ e@@ ment@@ .
At the same time@@ , neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better@@ .
They should then also be better pai@@ d@@ , Clinton dem@@ and@@ s.
The current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a pit@@ tan@@ ce@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ .
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour@@ .
It is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this sco@@ re@@ : Once he said that the minimum wage had to be rais@@ ed@@ , then he said it should stay the sam@@ e.
But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revol@@ ve around both parti@@ es@@ ' tax poli@@ ci@@ es@@ .
Trump is on one side@@ , wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost grow@@ th@@ .
His critics state that this will just increase the budgetary defic@@ it@@ .
Clinton is on the opposite side@@ : as a minim@@ um@@ , she wants the rich to pay more tax@@ es@@ , and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution ei@@ ther@@ .




Seek@@ ing refuge@@ : "@@ Every refugee woman has dealt with sexual viol@@ ence@@ "
For women fleeing a country on their own@@ , sexual violence is almost part of daily life@@ .
When they arrive in German@@ y@@ , they are often traumati@@ se@@ d.
One house offers refuge@@ .
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen@@ .
Every one of them has a baby with them@@ , the oldest of which is one year ol@@ d.
One woman holds her little son in her arm@@ s.
He looks around the room in@@ quisi@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ , his eyes wi@@ de@@ .
His mother sta@@ res at the tab@@ let@@ op@@ .
Un@@ til she realises she@@ '@@ s being watch@@ ed@@ .
She sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ isses the chil@@ d.
The scene looks normal@@ .
Un@@ til you start talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr@@ .
She is the field manager for Con@@ dro@@ bs@@ , a provider of social assistance within Bav@@ ari@@ a. One of the issues she deals with is refugee wom@@ en@@ .
The four women in the kitchen are refuge@@ es@@ .
They live in the north of Muni@@ ch@@ , in one of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey al@@ one@@ .
Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the centre in Janu@@ ary@@ , in collaboration with Pro Familia and the Munich W@@ omen@@ '@@ s Help organis@@ ation@@ .
It recently had its official open@@ ing@@ .
60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 chil@@ dren@@ .
There are no men - not even male visi@@ tor@@ s.
The exception is a body@@ guard on the door@@ .
"@@ I@@ '@@ m not exagger@@ ating when I say that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge@@ ,@@ " said B@@ ahr@@ .
"@@ Men flee because of war@@ , because they are politically persec@@ u@@ ted@@ , because they are threatened with torture or de@@ ath@@ , or because their families pin their hopes on them and send them to Europe@@ ,@@ " she expla@@ ins@@ .
When women fle@@ e@@ , other reasons are in the fore@@ ground@@ : "@@ Many women sne@@ ak away secre@@ t@@ ly@@ , because they see no other way out@@ "@@ .
In their home coun@@ tri@@ es@@ , they experienced sexual viol@@ ence@@ , forced marri@@ age@@ , honour kill@@ ings@@ , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution@@ .
That prop@@ els them forwar@@ d.
And it continues even while the@@ y@@ '@@ re on the run@@ .
"@@ It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water@@ , for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ ,@@ " says B@@ ahr@@ .
And the woman are al@@ one@@ , un@@ protected by their famili@@ es@@ .
If you think that this stops as soon as they arrive in German@@ y@@ , you@@ '@@ d be wrong@@ , says B@@ ahr@@ .
Even in German@@ y@@ , lone women are often seen as inferior in refugee accommod@@ ation@@ , and@@ , in the worst cas@@ es@@ , they are ab@@ us@@ ed@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , around 90 percent of the women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ sed@@ , she estim@@ at@@ es@@ .
"@@ Some of the children were certainly not conceived with the wom@@ an@@ '@@ s consent@@ "@@ .
Many women are so used to it that they do not say any@@ th@@ ing@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ .
"@@ Or they can@@ '@@ t bring themselves to talk about what they experienced because they are too ash@@ am@@ ed@@ "@@ .
Bec@@ ause they often don@@ '@@ t know how to get hel@@ p@@ , there needs to be more accommodation just for them@@ , says B@@ ahr@@ .
In Bav@@ ari@@ a@@ , the seven district governments are responsible for providing accommodation for refuge@@ es@@ .
When asked if they knew of projects like the one in Munich operating within the areas they cover@@ ed@@ , some answered with "@@ no@@ "@@ .
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia region@@ s@@ , for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , there is no similar accommodation offered by the govern@@ ment@@ .
Even in Sw@@ abi@@ a@@ , women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommod@@ ation@@ , says Karl@@ -@@ Heinz Me@@ yer@@ , press spokesperson for the region@@ .
In Upper Bav@@ ari@@ a@@ , Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia@@ , floor@@ s@@ , or individual hous@@ es@@ , are set aside in some shared accommodation for lone women and their chil@@ dren@@ .
The exception is Lower Bav@@ ari@@ a@@ : there@@ , there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for wom@@ en@@ .
Even the European Parlia@@ ment@@ '@@ s Committee on "@@ W@@ omen@@ '@@ s Rights and Gender E@@ quali@@ ty@@ " stresses that women must be provided with accommodation separate from that of the men@@ .
In a study published on behalf of the Commit@@ te@@ e@@ , it was stated that "@@ it is very important that men and women are given separate accommod@@ ation@@ .@@ "
"@@ If there is a lack of private spac@@ e@@ , or if men and women are provided with accommodation toge@@ ther@@ , this can result in (@@ perpetu@@ al@@ ) violence against wom@@ en@@ "@@ .
Was@@ hing facili@@ ti@@ es@@ , above all@@ , should be separ@@ ate@@ , and easily accessible for wom@@ en@@ , according to the stu@@ dy@@ .
The extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Muni@@ ch.
"@@ Since word has got around that we exist@@ , we have developed a long waiting list@@ ,@@ " says B@@ ahr@@ .
It would be easy to open a second house@@ .




Junior doctors stri@@ ke@@ : C@@ alls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contrac@@ t.
The Junior Doc@@ tors Committee (@@ J@@ DC@@ ) of the British Medical Association (@@ BM@@ A@@ ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early Sept@@ ember@@ .
The J@@ DC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contrac@@ t.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BM@@ A.
It was rejected by 58@@ % of its members who voted in the ball@@ ot@@ .
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night@@ , the J@@ DC@@ '@@ s chair Ellen Mc@@ Court said the government had remained "@@ persistently sil@@ ent@@ " on issues which@@ , she sa@@ id@@ , had resulted in the contract being re@@ jec@@ te@@ d.
She sa@@ id@@ : "@@ In light of th@@ is@@ , the J@@ DC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re@@ -@@ negotiations on all of your concern@@ s.@@ "
In response to the govern@@ ment@@ '@@ s silen@@ ce@@ , J@@ DC ex@@ ec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to authorise a rolling programme of escal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early Sept@@ ember@@ .
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year@@ , including the first all@@ -@@ out stopp@@ ages in the history of the NH@@ S.
The BM@@ A@@ '@@ s junior doctor lea@@ der@@ , Dr Johann Mala@@ wan@@ a@@ , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contrac@@ t@@ , which the BM@@ A had recommen@@ de@@ d.
He had told BM@@ A members the deal was a good one that should be accep@@ ted@@ , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54@@ ,000 junior doctors and medical stu@@ dent@@ s.
Fol@@ lowing the vot@@ e@@ , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medi@@ cs in Eng@@ land@@ .




Russia and Tur@@ key@@ : An '@@ alliance of mis@@ fit@@ s@@ '@@ ?
It was a gesture that ended a cri@@ si@@ s.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an ei@@ ght@@ -@@ month long war of words and economic sanc@@ tions@@ .
But@@ , as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of a St. Petersburg pal@@ ace@@ , I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the mo@@ st@@ .
There was the hand@@ sha@@ ke@@ , y@@ es@@ .
But Mr Put@@ in@@ '@@ s smile looked thin and he was hardly oo@@ zing warmth even by his own restrained standard@@ s.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "@@ dear friend@@ " Mr Putin - five tim@@ es@@ , according to one re@@ port@@ .
I lost coun@@ t.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre@@ -@@ crisis level@@ , but even high@@ er@@ .
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happ@@ en@@ ed@@ .
To me@@ , his enthusiasm implied the op@@ posi@@ te@@ .
But a ling@@ ering cool@@ ness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russi@@ a@@ '@@ s leader has forgotten no@@ th@@ ing@@ .
In fac@@ t@@ , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening com@@ ments@@ : Tur@@ key@@ '@@ s shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border@@ .
Mosco@@ w@@ '@@ s reaction at the time was fur@@ i@@ ous@@ .
Mr Putin las@@ hed out@@ , accusing Ankara of stab@@ bing Moscow in the back@@ .
The offence was even gre@@ ater@@ , coming from a supposed friend@@ .
Re@@ building real trust will be hard@@ , perhaps impos@@ si@@ ble@@ .
Russian public opinion has also turned since Nov@@ ember@@ .
For mon@@ th@@ s@@ , state@@ -@@ controlled media conducted a stag@@ gering@@ , all@@ -@@ out offensive against An@@ kar@@ a.
All of a su@@ dden@@ , it seemed like Turks were to blame for every@@ th@@ ing@@ .
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdo@@ gan@@ '@@ s own family has prof@@ ited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so@@ -@@ called Islamic State@@ .
He@@ '@@ s denied that emph@@ ati@@ call@@ y@@ .
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it@@ '@@ s time to move on@@ .
After all@@ , this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdo@@ gan@@ .
Russia could claim a victory of sor@@ ts@@ .
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are cle@@ ar@@ .
First and fore@@ mo@@ st@@ , Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ou@@ sted from power last month in a failed cou@@ p.
Re@@ peat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him to@@ o.
There is also an economic moti@@ ve@@ .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter fli@@ ghts@@ , which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year@@ .
The number has s@@ lum@@ ped by almost 90@@ %@@ .
As for Russi@@ a@@ , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resu@@ me@@ .
The@@ y@@ '@@ re banking on a late@@ -@@ season rush to the Mediterran@@ e@@ an@@ .
And even this week@@ , state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted aga@@ in@@ .
"@@ Tour@@ ists that way@@ , tomatoes back here@@ ,@@ " as a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti newspaper phra@@ sed it@@ .
But the visit also had additional political value for Mosco@@ w.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted take@@ over@@ .
Add to that its long@@ -@@ standing gru@@ dge at the sn@@ ail@@ '@@ s pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitali@@ se on the chill and chip away at Tur@@ key@@ '@@ s ties with the West@@ .
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted cou@@ p.
Mind you@@ , th@@ at@@ '@@ s a given for Moscow which has its own deep@@ -@@ seated fear of regime change@@ .
So the summit at this glitz@@ y@@ , seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "@@ alliance of mis@@ fit@@ s@@ "@@ : two countries that feel rejected and mistre@@ ated by the West@@ , joining for@@ ces@@ .
Still@@ , despite the public display of reconci@@ li@@ ation@@ , the two still have major differen@@ ces@@ .
The key one is Syri@@ a@@ , where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peac@@ em@@ aker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite si@@ des@@ .
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial tal@@ ks@@ , the two presidents told a press conference that they ha@@ dn@@ '@@ t even touched on the topic@@ .
Tur@@ key@@ '@@ s president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differen@@ ces@@ , while Mr Putin chose to underline them@@ .
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syri@@ a.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking aga@@ in@@ .




Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office ro@@ le@@ , according to the bank@@ '@@ s chief execu@@ ti@@ ve@@ .
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scot@@ land@@ .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank@@ '@@ s global ambi@@ tions@@ .
It has re@@ treated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be ba@@ iled out@@ .
During that time@@ , brand strate@@ gists have used '@@ R@@ B@@ S@@ ' to protect other consumer finance brand@@ s.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport@@ , from Six Nations ru@@ gby to Wimble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ray@@ .
But now@@ , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore@@ .
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish custom@@ ers@@ , but will not be initi@@ ali@@ se@@ d.
In England and Wal@@ es@@ , all RBS refer@@ en@@ ces@@ , outside head office and the stock exchange list@@ ing@@ , will be changed to Nat@@ West@@ .
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern I@@ rel@@ and@@ .
There are other@@ , smaller brands for private bank@@ ing@@ , which will get more prominence - C@@ out@@ ts@@ , Adam & Co@@ , Dru@@ mm@@ on@@ d@@ , and Hol@@ t@@ '@@ s Military Bank@@ .
Mr Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in In@@ vern@@ ess@@ -@@ shi@@ re@@ .
He told BBC Scot@@ land@@ : "@@ The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with@@ , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brand@@ s.@@ "
As the bank itself became a global brand@@ , RBS became the global brand@@ .
I@@ '@@ m now saying we no longer have global aspir@@ ations@@ , we have local aspir@@ ations@@ .
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communi@@ ti@@ es@@ , and our staff will work with customers under those brand@@ s.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship@@ , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship@@ .
"@@ The time is right for us to move to the bank of brand@@ s@@ , because underneath (@@ we@@ '@@ ve been as@@ king@@ ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for custom@@ ers@@ ?@@ " said the chief execu@@ ti@@ ve@@ .
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we@@ '@@ d said we@@ '@@ re going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there@@ .
But with the work we@@ '@@ ve been do@@ ing@@ , focussing on the customers need@@ s@@ , not our own@@ , I think you@@ '@@ re seeing a lot of change@@ .
We can bring those brands back up aga@@ in@@ , so I think the time is right@@ .

Two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20@@ -@@ time champion Sir Anthony McCo@@ y@@ , who had more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record@@ -@@ breaking care@@ er@@ .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ eys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before hi@@ m.
He is stylish and strong@@ , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room@@ .
He is a fantastic ambassador for rac@@ ing@@ , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma have been drawing fans to the sport for year@@ s.

Russi@@ a@@ '@@ s Putin s@@ acks chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov@@ .
Mr Ivan@@ ov has been part of Mr Put@@ in@@ '@@ s trusted inner circle for many year@@ s.
The 63@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issu@@ es@@ .
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "@@ decre@@ ed to relieve Ivan@@ ov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administr@@ ation@@ ,@@ " but gave no reason@@ .
Mr Ivan@@ ov@@ '@@ s deputy since 201@@ 2@@ , Anton Va@@ ino@@ , has been appointed as his success@@ or@@ .
Mr Va@@ ino@@ , 44@@ , is a former diplom@@ at@@ .
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 197@@ 2@@ , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (@@ M@@ G@@ IM@@ O@@ ) and served in the Tokyo em@@ bass@@ y@@ .
L@@ ater he managed presidential protocol and government staff@@ , the Kremlin website says (@@ in Russi@@ an@@ )@@ .

I think the administr@@ ation@@ '@@ s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemen@@ te@@ d.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave the post@@ , and recommended that Mr Va@@ ino should replace hi@@ m.
Do the sm@@ iles convinc@@ e@@ ?
This is a move that has mysti@@ fied Mosco@@ w.
Sergei Ivan@@ ov has long been one of Vladimir Put@@ in@@ '@@ s closest allies and@@ , like him@@ , served in the Soviet security service@@ , the K@@ G@@ B.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country@@ .
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request@@ .
But despite the sm@@ iles for the cam@@ er@@ as@@ , few here are convinced - especially now@@ , just before parliamentary elec@@ tions@@ .
So is this the fall@@ -@@ out from some kind of power strugg@@ le@@ ?
No@@ -@@ one knows y@@ et@@ .
But the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential pre@@ sident@@ , suddenly wanted to run Russi@@ a@@ '@@ s environmental policy - has been met with great scep@@ tic@@ ism@@ .
In remarks to Mr Put@@ in@@ , quoted on the Kremlin web@@ site@@ , Mr Ivan@@ ov said "@@ it@@ '@@ s true that in early 2012 I asked you@@ , in a convers@@ ation@@ , to entrust me with this very complicated post@@ , even - you could say - troubles@@ ome post@@ , for four year@@ s.
Well@@ , it turns out that I@@ '@@ ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight mon@@ th@@ s.
Mr Ivan@@ ov took up the post in December 201@@ 1.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister@@ .
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service@@ , like Mr Put@@ in@@ .
In the late 199@@ 0@@ s@@ , when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (@@ F@@ SB@@ )@@ , which replaced the K@@ GB@@ , Mr Ivan@@ ov was appointed as his dep@@ ut@@ y@@ .
When Mr Putin came to power@@ , he named Mr Ivan@@ ov as one of the five people he trusted mo@@ st@@ .
It was once thought that Mr Ivan@@ ov might become president of Russia after Mr Put@@ in@@ '@@ s second ter@@ m@@ , as a third term for Mr Putin would have been un@@ constitu@@ tion@@ al@@ .
But that post was taken by another close Putin all@@ y@@ , Dmit@@ ry Medve@@ de@@ v.
Mr Putin became prime minister@@ , before returning to the presidency just thre@@ e@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ half years later@@ .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing@@ : Bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
The £@@ 1.@@ 35@@ bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing@@ '@@ s north deck and vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe@@ .
It is the first of four closures between the "@@ deck fan@@ s@@ ,@@ " which are now ne@@ aring completion around each of the bri@@ d@@ ge@@ '@@ s three to@@ wer@@ s.
The bridge section from Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonn@@ es@@ .
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 sta@@ y@@ -@@ cab@@ les@@ .
The £@@ 1.@@ 35@@ bn project is now due to be complete by May 201@@ 7.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bri@@ d@@ ge@@ .
He sa@@ id@@ : "@@ This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sin@@ g.
We@@ '@@ re all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this projec@@ t@@ , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bri@@ d@@ ge@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit up@@ .
Over@@ all@@ , nearly 79@@ % of the total bridge deck is now in plac@@ e@@ , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Ro@@ sy@@ th to@@ day@@ , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bri@@ d@@ ge@@ .
Michael Martin@@ , For@@ th Cro@@ ssing Bridge Construc@@ tors project director sa@@ id@@ : "@@ The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant mile@@ st@@ one@@ .
On this fantastic projec@@ t@@ , this closure represents leading edge civil engine@@ er@@ ing@@ .
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck@@ , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or land@@ ward - side@@ .
This was done by pulling the northern approach vi@@ a@@ duct 700 milli@@ metres south@@ ward@@ s.
This was a massive and@@ , at the same time@@ , very delicate operation@@ .
Mas@@ sive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 222 metres long@@ , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3@@ %@@ .

Who is going to build Braunschwei@@ g@@ '@@ s low@@ -@@ cost hou@@ sing@@ ?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the fut@@ ure@@ .
How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low@@ -@@ cost homes over the next few year@@ s@@ ?
At the next council me@@ et@@ ing@@ , the SPD is going to put forward an "@@ action plan for hom@@ es@@ "@@ .
But it won@@ '@@ t be smooth sail@@ ing@@ .
First@@ ly@@ , there is the question of who is actually going to build the low@@ -@@ cost hom@@ es@@ ?
So far@@ , no settlement has been reached on this poin@@ t.
SPD group chair@@ man@@ , Christoph Brat@@ mann@@ , sa@@ ys@@ : "@@ We agree with the Gre@@ ens@@ : if you want to build on municipal land@@ , you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the fut@@ ure@@ .@@ "
The low@@ -@@ cost homes could also be older homes that are renov@@ at@@ ed@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the main issue for the coun@@ cil@@ , according to Brat@@ mann@@ : "@@ How do we handle investors who want to build on private ground@@ ?@@ "
We want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent@@ , but if possi@@ ble@@ , 20 percent@@ , of homes as social hou@@ sing@@ .@@ "
A new municipal programme to promote the construction of hom@@ es@@ , which will cost milli@@ ons@@ , and which still needs to be finan@@ c@@ ed@@ , will trigger concern@@ s.
The problem@@ , according to Brat@@ mann@@ : "@@ At the moment@@ , there is no agreement between group@@ s.@@ "
The CDU wants to put as few rules on investors as possi@@ ble@@ .
The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on invest@@ or@@ s.
Des@@ p@@ ite th@@ at@@ , according to Brat@@ man@@ , the situation in terms of the housing market is also hot@@ ting up@@ .
If the action plan is implemen@@ ted@@ , the building authorities will be faced with additional tas@@ ks@@ .
More staff will be ne@@ ede@@ d.
It is not clear if we will get the specialist staff@@ .
But the program is not quite comple@@ te@@ : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new homes are to be built any@@ way@@ .
But how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low@@ -@@ cost homes (@@ approxim@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ )@@ , the grants for which will run out over the next few year@@ s@@ ?
This will come to 500 homes even by 20@@ 20.
To prevent th@@ is@@ , according to Nicole Palm@@ , spokes@@ woman for planning policy@@ , bonds that are about to mature should be purchased by the municip@@ ali@@ ty@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scen@@ ari@@ o.
This is possible in the west of the city@@ .
The problem could be solved in one fell s@@ wo@@ op@@ .
This is because deadlines expire at the end of the year in the west of the city@@ .
A@@ round 1800 homes could then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable hou@@ sin@@ g.
The only problem is that their own@@ ers@@ , housing compani@@ es@@ , are against it@@ .
This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city@@ , taking a step back from the target of "@@ blend@@ ing@@ "@@ .
No longer are socially disadvantaged people to be concentrated in a small number of di@@ stric@@ ts@@ .
The Greens think there@@ '@@ s still room for manoeuvre in the disc@@ us@@ sions@@ .
Group chairman Hol@@ ger Her@@ li@@ tsch@@ ke thinks that "@@ the CDU will have to get into bed with us to reach a decent maj@@ or@@ ity@@ .@@ "
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , they have focused on providing more building sites for detached hom@@ es@@ .
But that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a com@@ promis@@ e.




Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world turn@@ s.
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more@@ , prefer@@ ring to spend their free time looking at scre@@ ens@@ , has been the lament of many for the the past dec@@ ade@@ .
Po@@ kem@@ on Go is getting people off the couch and into some activ@@ ity@@ .
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smart@@ ph@@ ones@@ .
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclu@@ si@@ ve@@ .
I am of course referring to the cra@@ ze that is Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go@@ , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (@@ it later spa@@ wned a cartoon seri@@ es@@ , playing cards and other spin off@@ s@@ )@@ .
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US@@ , Australia and New Zealand in early J@@ ul@@ y@@ .
The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive respon@@ se@@ , which over@@ loaded ser@@ vers@@ .
Wi@@ thin da@@ ys@@ , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twi@@ tter@@ .
So how does it work@@ ?
In a nut@@ shell@@ , players on smart@@ phones go out looking for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon@@ s@@ , which are tracked with a GPS and@@ , once found@@ , can be '@@ photograph@@ ed@@ ' (@@ via a screenshot on your ph@@ one@@ ) or '@@ cap@@ tu@@ red@@ '@@ .
A generation who played the game when younger have joined the cra@@ ze@@ , jumping off the couch for the search@@ .
In the US@@ , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "@@ aver@@ age@@ " person each day@@ .
Cardi@@ o@@ gram@@ , an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35@@ ,000 us@@ ers@@ , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game laun@@ ch@@ ing@@ , the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent@@ .
The company does not know who is playing Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise level@@ s.
Many public health campaigns to get people to "@@ find 30,@@ " "@@ get off the cou@@ ch@@ " and "@@ be active every@@ day@@ " have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miser@@ able@@ .
Y@@ et the importance of exercise cannot be under@@ stat@@ ed@@ .
T@@ hose who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depres@@ sion@@ .
Activity helps with weight management@@ , high blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here@@ .
But the beauty of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjo@@ y@@ .
Th@@ us you are covering three pillars of health - mo@@ ve@@ ment@@ , fresh air and sun@@ sh@@ ine@@ , and fun@@ .
Some people are even making new friends on the hun@@ t.
As usual there are po@@ -@@ faced kill@@ jo@@ ys looking for something to complain ab@@ out@@ .
And yes somebody might walk into a door@@ .
So what@@ ?
A breakthrough has occur@@ re@@ d.
For while smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could previously track our activ@@ ity@@ , they did@@ n@@ '@@ t give us a reason to exercise like this game do@@ es@@ .
The novelty will wear off and use will sub@@ side in due cour@@ se@@ .
However because of Po@@ k@@ me@@ on@@ '@@ s success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world@@ , helping many people on the hunt to be more acti@@ ve@@ , fit@@ ter and heal@@ th@@ ier@@ .

The 19@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old American gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast soared to the all@@ -@@ around title on Thurs@@ day@@ , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spot@@ light@@ .

Bil@@ es became the fourth straight American woman to win the all@@ -@@ around title and fifth overall while ce@@ menting her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever@@ .
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ende@@ d.
The achievement puts her in the same league as on@@ ce@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ generation athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have taken their sports to new heigh@@ ts@@ :

One last test awaited in Bra@@ z@@ il@@ , a contest not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expec@@ tations@@ .
Any@@ thing less than heading back to her famil@@ y@@ '@@ s home in Spring@@ , Tex@@ as@@ , with a fi@@ st@@ ful of gol@@ ds would be seen as a dis@@ appoin@@ t@@ ment@@ .

Balance beam and floor exercise - where Bil@@ es is the defending world champion - lay in wa@@ it@@ .
She went back in front with a 15.@@ 433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on floor@@ .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Bil@@ es@@ ' gli@@ tter@@ y red@@ , white and blue ey@@ el@@ iner when the vision she once wrote in a scrap@@ book became a reali@@ ty@@ .

Polic@@ e@@ : 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old girl who died in the dead@@ liest attack in Pho@@ eni@@ x@@ '@@ s first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were sh@@ ot@@ , according to police reports released Thurs@@ day@@ .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er@@ , Stefan@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis@@ ' daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way@@ , authorities sa@@ i@@ d.
The gun@@ man fired as many as eight shots from a hand@@ gun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehi@@ cle@@ , the report states@@ .
Police say the triple killing do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t appear to have been the result of a rob@@ bery because the attacker did@@ n@@ '@@ t take pur@@ ses or $@@ 2,@@ 900 in the possession of one of the adult vic@@ tim@@ s.
Phoenix police spokesman S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attack@@ s.
In all@@ , seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly His@@ panic neighborhoods over a four@@ -@@ month peri@@ od@@ .
"@@ It@@ '@@ s occurring within a residential area in front of a home@@ ,@@ " Howard said to CBS affiliate K@@ PH@@ O earlier this mon@@ th@@ .
The suspect is believed to have used several vehi@@ cl@@ es@@ , including as a late@@ -@@ 1990s brown Nis@@ san@@ , a late@@ -@@ 1990s black BMW and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n.
Investi@@ g@@ ators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same k@@ iller@@ .

A witness told police that it was@@ n@@ '@@ t unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to musi@@ c.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an un@@ occupied pickup truck just a half@@ -@@ hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial k@@ iller@@ .

Mother of 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y@@ : "@@ It gets better@@ "
Like most six@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ ol@@ ds@@ , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves sing@@ ing@@ , toys and@@ , of cour@@ se@@ , his mother@@ .
But unlike most of his pe@@ ers@@ , Edmund has micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y@@ , the result of a genetic disorder his mo@@ m Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did@@ n@@ '@@ t know about while pregn@@ ant@@ .
When he first came home my initial thought was@@ , I can@@ '@@ t do th@@ is@@ .
I can@@ '@@ t do th@@ is@@ .
I did@@ n@@ '@@ t sign up for th@@ is@@ .
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it@@ ,@@ " she sa@@ i@@ d.
She and her hus@@ band@@ , Vinc@@ ent@@ , were told Edmund might never recognize them@@ , and that he might not even survi@@ ve@@ .
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institution@@ aliz@@ ed@@ .
"@@ My first response was '@@ I did@@ n@@ '@@ t think people did that any@@ more@@ ,@@ '@@ " Pic@@ ci@@ uto expla@@ in@@ ed@@ .
Edmund walks with the help of a wal@@ ker@@ .

Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "@@ please sing to me@@ .@@ "
"@@ We@@ '@@ re teaching him sign langu@@ age@@ ,@@ " Pic@@ ci@@ uto told CBS New@@ s.
But it@@ '@@ s not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own sign@@ s.
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y can arise from a number of different condi@@ tions@@ : genetic ones like Ed@@ mund@@ '@@ s@@ , and infections during pregnancy from viruses like meas@@ les and Zi@@ ka@@ .

Heavy rain@@ , flooding prompts rescu@@ es in Louisi@@ ana@@ , Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Fri@@ day@@ , with more rain expected over the state through Satur@@ day@@ .
Num@@ erous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were over@@ flowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rain@@ fall@@ , the National We@@ ather Service re@@ porte@@ d.
Louisiana Gov@@ . John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local offici@@ als@@ , and assistance is already on the move to affected par@@ ish@@ es@@ .
Mike Ste@@ ele@@ , a spokesman for the Govern@@ or@@ '@@ s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Pre@@ pare@@ d@@ ness@@ , said requests were coming in for high@@ -@@ water vehi@@ cl@@ es@@ , boats and sand@@ bag@@ s.
Ste@@ ele said Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bag@@ s.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisi@@ an@@ a.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the are@@ a.
In south Alab@@ ama@@ , a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile are@@ a.
The Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rouge and A@@ mite River near Den@@ ham Spr@@ ings@@ , both in Louisi@@ ana@@ , were predicted to set record cre@@ sts over the week@@ end@@ .
Fo@@ rec@@ aster Ale@@ k Krau@@ tmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge@@ .
He also said that flooding downstream in A@@ scen@@ sion Parish is a threat@@ , as those s@@ wollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Mau@@ re@@ pas@@ .
The Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River@@ , just south of the Mississippi state line in Liver@@ pool@@ , Louisi@@ ana@@ , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Fri@@ day@@ .
Res@@ cu@@ ers were still plu@@ cking people from flood@@ waters in A@@ mite and Wil@@ kinson counties in southwest Mississi@@ pp@@ i.
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ for@@ d@@ , his wife and step@@ son were among those rescued earlier Friday near Glo@@ ster@@ .

Police say a 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old boy has been shot in Philadel@@ phi@@ a@@ , marking the second shooting of a 6@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old in the city this week@@ .
The child@@ '@@ s grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Maha@@ j Bro@@ wn@@ .
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gun@@ shot wo@@ und@@ s@@ , including in his gro@@ in@@ , leg@@ , arm and ab@@ dom@@ en@@ , but was awake when he was transported to the hosp@@ ital@@ .
"@@ He just took a lot@@ , his little body was ri@@ ddled with bul@@ le@@ ts@@ ,@@ " his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z tells the station@@ .
I just can@@ '@@ t believe it@@ .
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several sur@@ geri@@ es@@ .
Family tells the station he is expected to recover@@ .
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school@@ .
Brown was among four people shot in the German@@ town sec@@ tion@@ .
Also shot were three men@@ : two 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds and one 32@@ -@@ year ol@@ d.
One of the 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old men was reported in critical condition@@ ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition@@ , according to CBS Philadel@@ phi@@ a.

Why we need Sim@@ one@@ , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
That@@ '@@ s what I call this year@@ '@@ s W@@ omen@@ '@@ s Olympic Gy@@ mnas@@ tics Team and for more reasons than one@@ .
First@@ , I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so domin@@ ant@@ .
And secon@@ d@@ : This team features three gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast@@ s@@ , Simone Bil@@ es@@ , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren "@@ Lau@@ rie@@ " Her@@ nan@@ dez@@ , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color@@ .
The make@@ -@@ up of this team@@ , rounded out by A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man@@ , who is Je@@ wish@@ , and Madison Ko@@ ci@@ an@@ , who is Catho@@ lic@@ , is making everyone prou@@ d.
This team look@@ s@@ , fin@@ all@@ y@@ , like Ameri@@ ca.
It also has solidi@@ fied the black and Lat@@ ina female presence at the top of this sport@@ .
For the past four year@@ s@@ , the number one female gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast has been Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can@@ .
Last year@@ , Simone and Gab@@ by were #@@ 1 and #@@ 2.
This is power@@ ful@@ .
Last Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champi@@ on@@ , and America cheer@@ ed@@ .
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of thre@@ e@@ -@@ time World Champion Simone Bil@@ es@@ , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez delivering the un@@ expec@@ ted@@ , yet master@@ ful gymnas@@ tics rout@@ ines@@ .
On Thurs@@ day@@ , Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the wom@@ en@@ '@@ s individual all@@ -@@ around event@@ .
And team@@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man earned sil@@ ver@@ .
We are witnessing the top of the sport@@ , but it does not look like this at gymnas@@ tics classes across the country@@ .
Sim@@ one@@ , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all took the same path as A@@ ly and Madison to make the Olympic team@@ .
They are the "@@ Final Fi@@ ve@@ " because the next Olympic gymnas@@ tics team will only have four gy@@ mna@@ sts on the team@@ , and this is Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i@@ '@@ s last year co@@ ach@@ ing@@ .
But the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport@@ , and gy@@ mna@@ sts primarily train in private gymnas@@ tics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the tra@@ ining@@ , facilit@@ y@@ , travel@@ , uniform@@ s@@ , competition fe@@ es@@ , hotel fees (@@ for the coaches and their gy@@ mna@@ sts and famili@@ es@@ ) and the list goes on@@ .
Most of these gymnas@@ tics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business@@ .
These clubs are where the gy@@ mna@@ sts get all of their tra@@ ining@@ , and it@@ '@@ s a costly and long@@ -@@ term commitment for the gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast@@ s@@ ' famili@@ es@@ .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man@@ , coach of Simone Bil@@ es@@ , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey@@ , coach of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez@@ , have both co@@ ached their athletes since they started in gymnas@@ tic@@ s.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnas@@ tics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one@@ , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie@@ .
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation 20 years ag@@ o.
At my organiz@@ ations@@ , we have provided free and low@@ -@@ cost gymnas@@ tic@@ s@@ , based in Har@@ lem@@ , for over 15,000 urban youth (@@ primarily black and His@@ pan@@ ic@@ ) and have trained national and international champi@@ ons@@ .
In Sept@@ ember@@ , we will be expanding to Detroit (@@ my hom@@ et@@ own@@ ) to provide high quality gymnas@@ tics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport@@ .
Gy@@ mnas@@ tics develops strength@@ , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work@@ , discipline and determination for the min@@ d.
This combination provides life@@ -@@ long benefits for good heal@@ th@@ , success in school and work@@ .
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnas@@ tics and that is great@@ .
To participate in sport is so import@@ ant@@ , especially for girl@@ s.
This is such an exciting time@@ .
Thank you Sim@@ one@@ , Aly@@ , Lau@@ rie@@ , Gab@@ by and Madison for that serious showcase of "@@ Girl Power@@ " in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be heal@@ thy@@ , strong and successful young wom@@ en@@ .




Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hun@@ t@@ '@@ s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association offici@@ als@@ , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it@@ .
In J@@ ul@@ y@@ , Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the N@@ HS was in "@@ no man@@ '@@ s land@@ " and any further delay would be damaging for staff and pati@@ ent@@ s.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contrac@@ t@@ , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hour@@ s.
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Cour@@ t@@ , the BM@@ A@@ '@@ s junior doc@@ tor@@ s@@ " committee chair@@ , said in a statement last night@@ : "@@ Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contrac@@ t@@ , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce cri@@ sis@@ , and that it fails to treat all doctors fair@@ ly@@ .@@ "
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contrac@@ t@@ , progress needs to be made and time is running out@@ .
Eff@@ orts by the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and@@ , at tim@@ es@@ , de@@ af@@ ening silence from the govern@@ ment@@ .
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open@@ .
"@@ Jeremy Hunt needs to act now@@ , lift the imposition and address junior doc@@ tor@@ s@@ " concern@@ s.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial ac@@ tion@@ .
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the pi@@ cket line@@ .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association offici@@ al@@ s.
The BM@@ A wants better weekend pay for the 54@@ ,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contrac@@ t.
Daniel Mor@@ tim@@ er@@ , chief executive of N@@ HS Emp@@ loy@@ ers@@ , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any stri@@ kes@@ .
Mr Mor@@ timer sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Industrial action achieves little or no@@ th@@ ing@@ , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes wor@@ ry@@ , distress and disruption for pati@@ ents@@ , carers and their famili@@ es.@@ "
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee and ha@@ ve@@ , along with the Department of Health and other@@ s@@ , responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ing@@ .
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deplo@@ y@@ ment@@ , flexibility in tra@@ ining@@ , additional training for those returning from career break@@ s@@ , costs of tra@@ ining@@ , mutual recognition of syll@@ ab@@ us@@ , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employ@@ ers@@ , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BM@@ A in Nov@@ ember@@ , February and May@@ .




The £@@ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Th@@ ous@@ ands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £@@ 2@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ day dru@@ g@@ , after officials recommended it be given to more people for lon@@ ger@@ .
Anti@@ -@@ cl@@ ot@@ ting drug tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or slas@@ hes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart dise@@ as@@ e.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack@@ , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack@@ .

But now N@@ HS watch@@ dog N@@ ICE has advised that it should be given to people for four year@@ s@@ , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problem@@ s.
Some 14@@ 0,000 people have a heart attack in England every year@@ , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stro@@ ke@@ .
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the buil@@ d@@ -@@ up of fatty material in ar@@ tery walls to form a pla@@ que@@ .
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood cl@@ ot@@ , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack@@ .
And if the clo@@ t dis@@ lodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the bra@@ in@@ , causing a stro@@ ke@@ .
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having an@@ other@@ .

Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son@@ , director at the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation cent@@ re@@ , sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Des@@ p@@ ite the availability of effective secondary prevention treat@@ ments@@ , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequ@@ en@@ ces@@ .@@ "
Fe@@ ar of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person@@ '@@ s quality of life@@ .
The evidence shows that tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or@@ , in combination with aspir@@ in@@ , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack@@ .
In provisionally recommending tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it@@ .
Bec@@ ause information on the efficacy and safety of tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limit@@ ed@@ , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that peri@@ od@@ .




PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex@@ -@@ Tower Ham@@ lets mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office last year for cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ , prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communi@@ ti@@ es@@ , a devastating government report reveals to@@ day@@ .
Ex@@ -@@ Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pick@@ les lam@@ ba@@ sts the poli@@ ce@@ , election watch@@ dogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "@@ over@@ -@@ sensitivities about ethnicity and religi@@ on@@ .@@ "
The former communities secre@@ tar@@ y@@ , now the anti@@ -@@ corruption ts@@ ar@@ , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cord@@ ons outside polling stations to protect frightened vo@@ ters@@ .
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vot@@ e.
Cur@@ rent@@ ly@@ , a voter merely has to state their name and addre@@ ss@@ .
The report even suggests putting inde@@ li@@ ble ink on a person@@ '@@ s fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twi@@ ce@@ .
Greater protection should be given to whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ s@@ , Sir Eric sa@@ ys@@ .
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working group@@ s.
"@@ This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud@@ , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
The report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street in the wake of the Tower Ham@@ lets voting scandal in East London@@ .
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting may@@ or@@ , Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man@@ , should be removed from office following a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practic@@ es@@ .
The court found Rah@@ man "@@ cyni@@ cally perver@@ ted@@ " the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silen@@ ced his critics with accusations of racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ a.
Rah@@ man@@ , it was sa@@ id@@ , "@@ ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him@@ .@@ "
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of person@@ ation@@ , where a person votes while posing as someone else@@ .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country@@ .
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choo@@ sin@@ g.
Sir Eric@@ , pictu@@ red@@ , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report sa@@ ys@@ : "@@ Evi@@ dence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communi@@ ti@@ es@@ , particularly women and young pe@@ op@@ le@@ , to vote according to the will of the el@@ der@@ s@@ , especially in communities of Pakistani and Banglades@@ hi back@@ ground@@ .
"@@ There were concerns th@@ at@@ ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "@@ politically correc@@ t@@ " over@@ -@@ sensitivities about ethnicity and religi@@ on@@ .@@ "
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system@@ , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "@@ vote har@@ vest@@ ing.@@ "
The re@@ port@@ , being considered by Theresa May@@ , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit frau@@ d.
Consi@@ der the options for requiring voters to produce ID before vot@@ ing@@ .
Use inde@@ li@@ ble ink on a person@@ '@@ s fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twi@@ ce@@ .
Car@@ ry out systematic checks on a person@@ '@@ s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vot@@ e.
Pu@@ t a thre@@ e@@ -@@ year limit on requests for an automatic postal vot@@ e.
Ban political campaign@@ ers and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelop@@ es@@ .
Gi@@ ve police powers to set up cord@@ ons around polling st@@ ations@@ .
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 198@@ 3.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling st@@ ations@@ .
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (@@ except in Wal@@ es@@ )@@ .
Str@@ eng@@ then training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth al@@ one@@ .
Sir Eric sav@@ ages the Metropolitan Polic@@ e@@ , saying it is "@@ aston@@ ish@@ ing@@ " that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Ham@@ lets cas@@ e.
"@@ The election court dis@@ qualified Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his agent for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practic@@ es@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of ground@@ s.
He also criticises the in@@ effec@@ tual "@@ tick@@ -@@ box inspec@@ tions@@ " of town hall electoral registration de@@ part@@ ments@@ .
Sir Eric sa@@ id@@ : "@@ Last year@@ '@@ s court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets was a wak@@ e@@ -@@ up call@@ .
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parlia@@ ments@@ , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good rep@@ ut@@ ation@@ .

How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
It@@ '@@ s a dangerous world out there@@ , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com might help make it a little safer for you@@ .
We spoke to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi@@ , New Yor@@ k@@ -@@ based grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Feder@@ ation@@ , to find out how to deal with gun@@ -@@ tot@@ ing mug@@ gers at close ran@@ ge@@ .
Whe@@ ther you@@ '@@ re approached from in front or behin@@ d@@ , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mug@@ ger@@ .
If approached from behin@@ d@@ , Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi sa@@ ys@@ , the first thing to do is turn aro@@ und@@ , so that you can see your attacker and '@@ clear the line of fire@@ '@@ .
You then grasp the gun between your fore@@ arm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free el@@ bo@@ w.
A knee to the gro@@ in fol@@ low@@ s@@ , and while the attacker doubles up in pain@@ , you twist the gun from his hand@@ s@@ , sm@@ ack him in the face with the barrel and back up@@ , keeping the weapon trained on hi@@ m.
For gun@@ men approaching from the front@@ , it@@ '@@ s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire@@ , grab the gun and twist it around so the vil@@ lain can@@ '@@ t fire@@ .
At the same time@@ , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest@@ , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at hi@@ m.
Sounds trick@@ y@@ ?
Check the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi does it@@ .
But remember that the safest way out of any mu@@ gging - if you@@ '@@ re not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a grand@@ master - is to hand over your cas@@ h.




Traveller Ian Wright scrap@@ es his tongue along Europe@@ '@@ s dir@@ ti@@ est places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and ga@@ g reflex to a serious test - by li@@ cking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe@@ .
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wri@@ ght@@ , 5@@ 1@@ , from Suff@@ ol@@ k@@ , scrap@@ ed his tongue along a Euro note@@ , a Piccadilly Circus hand rail@@ , a train toi@@ let@@ '@@ s flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system@@ .
Before li@@ cking each objec@@ t@@ , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show him@@ self@@ , and us@@ , just what he was getting in to@@ .
But the experiment@@ , which has be made into a film called The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker@@ '@@ s Guide to Inner Str@@ eng@@ th@@ , threw up some surprising resul@@ ts@@ .
The thought of li@@ cking a train@@ '@@ s flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly rep@@ ell@@ ent@@ , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink@@ .
All the way along his trip through Europe@@ , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own heal@@ th@@ .
Fort@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ , nothing he li@@ cked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth@@ .
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful th@@ ing@@ s.
From public hand@@ rails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
In the movie made about it he sa@@ id@@ : '@@ E@@ ver since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I@@ '@@ ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from so@@ il@@ , eating worms and mu@@ ddy water@@ .@@ '
He certainly proved his reputation during the fil@@ m.
The only thing he turned down was a fil@@ thy Russian public toi@@ let@@ .
His sample swa@@ b showed a lumin@@ ometer count of over 4000 unit@@ s.
By compar@@ ison@@ , freshly washed hands should come in under 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his lumin@@ ometer count was over 4000 unit@@ s@@ , when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Vali@@ o have produced the trav@@ eller@@ '@@ s film called The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker@@ '@@ s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
He said in the film@@ : '@@ That is close to one of the worst things I have sm@@ elled in a toi@@ let@@ .@@ '
There@@ '@@ s nothing more dirty than th@@ at@@ !
I@@ '@@ m not going to lick anything because it@@ '@@ s disgu@@ sting in there@@ .
The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker@@ '@@ s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Vali@@ o.
The company provided Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us@@ , which contain l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost pe@@ op@@ le@@ '@@ s gut bacteria and immune system@@ s.
Vali@@ o@@ '@@ s Senior Vice President of Snack@@ s@@ , Ju@@ ice and New Categ@@ ories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ maa sa@@ id@@ : '@@ We really wanted to offer consumers something new@@ .
Some@@ thing that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tic@@ s.
We did a lot of crazy bra@@ instor@@ ming that ended in the idea "@@ let@@ '@@ s call I@@ an@@ .@@ "
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
In@@ stead of just talking about the produc@@ ts@@ , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environ@@ ment@@ , the importance of gut health and how it@@ '@@ s linked to the immune system@@ .
Gro@@ wing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way@@ .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of hu@@ mour@@ !
Tom Hak@@ al@@ a@@ , who directed the film@@ , ad@@ de@@ d@@ : '@@ Let@@ '@@ s put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had li@@ cked some of the things I asked him to@@ , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet th@@ at@@ '@@ s shown in the fil@@ m.@@ '
Natur@@ ally some things were easier to get Ian to li@@ ck@@ , some were pretty tough@@ .
I@@ '@@ m glad we got some of those dirty li@@ cks caught on ta@@ pe@@ .@@ '
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Vali@@ o@@ , 84 per cent of the respondents associated l@@ actic acid bacteria specifically with the well@@ -@@ being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added l@@ actic acid bacteri@@ a.




Family of yo@@ bs destroyed Sal@@ t@@ ash@@ , Cornwall council house ahead of evi@@ ction
A family of yo@@ bs left their council house with £@@ 50,000 worth of damage after they were e@@ vic@@ ted for terror@@ ising their neighbour@@ s.
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner S@@ hau@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been kicked out of the property in Sal@@ t@@ ash@@ , Corn@@ wall@@ , after a long list of complaints against them@@ .
After they were forcibly removed from the proper@@ ty@@ , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of dis@@ repair@@ .
The walls were left with g@@ aping hol@@ es@@ , floor@@ boards were ri@@ pped up@@ , rubbish was stre@@ wn over the floor and graffiti was dau@@ bed on the wall@@ s.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna Mc@@ E@@ voy@@ , housing manager at Cornwall Hou@@ sing@@ , said she feared it might be beyond sav@@ ing@@ .
She sa@@ id@@ : '@@ It@@ '@@ s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don@@ '@@ t think people should have to live like th@@ at@@ .
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ nice element of Corn@@ wall@@ .
This family are notorious and their name is notori@@ ous@@ .
The couple had three sons who lived at the property inter@@ mitt@@ ently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball b@@ ats@@ , intimi@@ dating nearby re@@ sident@@ s@@ , drug use@@ , drug dealing and excessive sh@@ out@@ ing@@ , arguing and swe@@ ar@@ ing@@ .
Skel@@ don@@ , 47@@ , whose name was on the ten@@ anc@@ y@@ , was given an anti@@ social behaviour order in Jun@@ e.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house@@ , which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the proper@@ ty@@ , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neigh@@ bours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing e@@ vic@@ ted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on volun@@ tar@@ il@@ y@@ .
The evi@@ ction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell@@ .
One sa@@ id@@ : '@@ They did@@ n@@ '@@ t care about any@@ body@@ .@@ '
We lived next to them for 20 years and it@@ '@@ s always been bad@@ .
The amount of times we@@ '@@ ve seen the police down here is unbelie@@ v@@ able@@ .
'@@ This mor@@ ning@@ , we cou@@ ld@@ n@@ '@@ t sle@@ ep@@ .@@ '
We got up because it was so quiet here - we@@ '@@ re not used to th@@ at@@ !
It@@ '@@ s going to be lovely now that the@@ y@@ '@@ re finally g@@ one@@ .
Adam Fitz@@ patri@@ ck@@ , Cornwall Hou@@ sing@@ '@@ s neighbourhood enforcement man@@ ager@@ , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authorit@@ y@@ .
The family have lived in the house for 20 year@@ s@@ , with police regularly called to the property
Rub@@ bish and old toys have been thrown down the over@@ grown side of the council house
He ad@@ de@@ d@@ : '@@ It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as evi@@ ction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing consider@@ s.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witn@@ ess@@ .
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team@@ , Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bra@@ vely came forward to give us information@@ .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that anti@@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ at@@ ed@@ .
Mr Fitz@@ patri@@ ck said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20@@ s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the evi@@ ction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 201@@ 4@@ , police rai@@ ded the property and found more than 70@@ g in cannabis as well as scal@@ es@@ , parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and £@@ 1,@@ 700 in cas@@ h.
Skel@@ don was fined after ple@@ ading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to sup@@ pl@@ y@@ .
She claimed the money was going towards a head@@ stone for her son@@ , Lee Skel@@ don@@ , who died in a car crash in 201@@ 3.
After being made hom@@ el@@ ess@@ , it is understood that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in private housing in Ply@@ mouth@@ .
The walls of many of the house@@ '@@ s rooms had graffiti scra@@ w@@ led across them@@ .
Police say they will seek to e@@ vic@@ t tenants who fl@@ out the rules of their ten@@ ancies
Angela Crow@@ , of Devon and Cornwall Polic@@ e@@ , said the evi@@ ction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to fl@@ out the rul@@ es@@ .
'@@ This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without rec@@ rimin@@ ation@@ , as well as those bli@@ ghted by such behavi@@ our@@ ,@@ ' she sa@@ i@@ d.
Criminal and anti@@ social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Polic@@ e@@ , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communi@@ ti@@ es@@ .

Tour@@ ists sun wor@@ shipping in Av@@ ei@@ ro@@ , Portu@@ gal@@ , had the shock of their lives
A Portuguese air force P@@ -@@ 3C Orion plane s@@ wo@@ op@@ ed in incredibly low
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
This is the moment terri@@ fied tourists start to panic as a low@@ -@@ flying jet s@@ wo@@ op@@ ed down over a packed beach@@ .
Dra@@ matic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sun@@ seekers on the stretch of sand in Av@@ ei@@ ro@@ , northern Portu@@ gal@@ .
Holi@@ day@@ makers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clou@@ d@@ s.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Av@@ eiro yesterday afterno@@ on@@ .
Daniel Fern@@ and@@ es@@ , one of several holiday@@ makers who posted videos of the dramatic fly@@ -@@ by onto social media@@ , sa@@ id@@ : '@@ It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to cra@@ sh@@ .@@ '

Tour@@ ists on the beach at Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane appeared out of the mur@@ k and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P@@ -@@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them@@ .
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wild@@ fi@@ res@@ , but the air force insisted no@@ -@@ one@@ '@@ s safety had been com@@ promis@@ ed@@ .
Wild@@ fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Mad@@ ei@@ ra@@ .

The Catalan team will face off against FC Sevilla in an away game in Spa@@ in@@ '@@ s Super@@ cup@@ ; the second leg will take place three days later in Camp Nou@@ .
The two@@ -@@ time champions will have to face up to the defeated Cup finalists and reign@@ ing Europa League champions without Ney@@ mar@@ , who is playing in the Olympic football tournament for Bra@@ z@@ il@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , go@@ al@@ keeper Marc@@ -@@ Andre ter Ste@@ gen is also mis@@ sin@@ g.
During training the German pulled a li@@ ga@@ ment in his kne@@ e. At least it@@ '@@ s clear who@@ '@@ ll be wearing the number one jersey for Bar@@ ca@@ : Claudio Bra@@ vo@@ .
The Chilean international and T@@ er Stei@@ gen have been competing for number one status for two years no@@ w.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision either way@@ , allowing Bravo to wear the jersey in league gam@@ es@@ , but giving it to T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most of their other mat@@ ch@@ es@@ .
A@@ head of the first compulsory game of the new season there were doubts as to the Spanish champi@@ ons@@ ' fit@@ ness@@ : they lost 0@@ -@@ 4 to Liverpool in a friendly game on Satur@@ day@@ .
Even with 3@@ -2 in a friendly against Samp@@ d@@ oria on Wedn@@ es@@ day@@ , Lionel Mess@@ i and co@@ . were not really all that convinc@@ ing@@ .

Ma Long is in a league of his own@@ , taking Gold in the table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - Ma Long@@ , from Chin@@ a@@ , is the new table tennis Olympic champi@@ on@@ .
On Thurs@@ day@@ , the 27@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old beat his fellow country@@ man and "@@ defending champi@@ on@@ " Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke in Rio de Janeiro 4@@ -@@ 0 in a one@@ -@@ sided final (@@ 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4@@ )@@ .
This gave the world number one the "@@ golden grand s@@ lam@@ "@@ , winning the World Champi@@ on@@ ship@@ , the World C@@ up@@ , the final tournament of the World Tour@@ , and the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
The bronze medal went to Jun Mi@@ zu@@ tan@@ i from Jap@@ an@@ .
The two Chinese men made it to the fin@@ al@@ , as expec@@ ted@@ , and fought each other for the tit@@ le@@ .
It was clear th@@ at@@ , for the third time in a row@@ , a Chinese athlete would take the singles title at the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
The last non@@ -@@ Chinese athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium was former SV@@ S Lower Austria legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung@@ -@@ min from South Kore@@ a.
Ma and Z@@ hang were alone at the table@@ : they had no coaches with them between sets and during time@@ -@@ outs@@ .
They had returned to the stands@@ , leaving their charges alone to fight a fair battle against each other@@ .
"@@ Up until now@@ , I have played for my country@@ .@@ "
"@@ In the fin@@ al@@ , I@@ '@@ m playing for my@@ self@@ ,@@ " Z@@ hang summ@@ ar@@ is@@ ed@@ .
After the g@@ ame@@ , the gold and silver med@@ al@@ lists posed with the Chinese flag@@ .
The match itself was unexpectedly one@@ -@@ side@@ d.
Ma only had to fight off his 28@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old opponent in the first set@@ .
After@@ war@@ ds@@ , he set the pace on the table@@ , and only let Z@@ hang score a total of 13 poin@@ ts@@ .
Ma@@ '@@ s dominance meant that the match was not as exciting as expec@@ te@@ d.
But ne@@ ver@@ thel@@ ess@@ , there were some breathtaking vol@@ leys to be se@@ en@@ .
Mi@@ zu@@ tan@@ i won the bronze medal match against 40@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old Wladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4@@ -@@ 1.
The Belar@@ ussian had injured his ri@@ b in his quar@@ ter@@ -@@ final against German European Champion Dimitrij O@@ v@@ t@@ char@@ ov@@ , and was given medical treat@@ ment@@ , and ultimately had to content himself with fourth plac@@ e.
Jan@@ -@@ O@@ ve Waldner from Sweden (@@ 38@@ /@@ 2004@@ ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson (@@ 4@@ 2@@ /@@ 200@@ 8@@ ) also reached fourth place at the Olympics at a similarly old age for table ten@@ nis@@ .




Donald Trump admits there are "@@ huge problem@@ s@@ " with his election campaign
The US Republi@@ can@@ s@@ ' lead is plagued by significant fears that they might lose their maj@@ or@@ ity@@ , even in states that are traditionally conserv@@ ati@@ ve@@ .
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to the weaknesses of his election campaign in U@@ tah@@ , formerly a Republican stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ d.
It was a strange moment - the multi@@ -@@ million@@ aire normally puts on a pom@@ p@@ ous@@ , self@@ -@@ assured perform@@ ance@@ , but this time he expressed something analogous to doub@@ t@@ , as correspon@@ dents re@@ port@@ .
After he had beaten 16 rivals from within the Republican camp@@ , doubt is now growing as to whether he will be successful in the race for the White Hou@@ se@@ .
"@@ We have huge problems in U@@ tah@@ ,@@ " Trump said to an audience of evange@@ li@@ cal Christians whom he asked for assistance in key states such as O@@ hi@@ o@@ , Florida or Virg@@ ini@@ a.
He blamed false reports on his candid@@ ac@@ y@@ , once again giving the media a dres@@ sing@@ -@@ down@@ , as he is known to do@@ .
Republican stron@@ gh@@ olds are wa@@ vering
Utah is normally a safe seat for the Republi@@ can@@ s.
A poll carried out by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June puts Trump and his competitor on an equal footing with Democrat Hillary Clin@@ ton@@ .
Other bodies do put Trump ah@@ e@@ ad@@ , but not by the margin usual for Republican candidates in the state@@ .
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk@@ .
In an interview with broadcaster CN@@ B@@ C@@ , Trump was asked how he would stop Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s ris@@ e@@ , re@@ pl@@ y@@ ing@@ : "@@ In the same way I have done before@@ "@@ .
And he ad@@ de@@ d@@ : "@@ Ei@@ ther it@@ '@@ ll work out@@ , or I@@ '@@ ll go on a long@@ , long holiday@@ "@@ .
He said he was just "@@ telling the tru@@ th@@ "@@ .

Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ : Bra@@ zen cheating in doping tests
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee to handle the cas@@ e.
Fol@@ lowing the second doping scandal at the Rio Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ , trouble is looming for Ken@@ ya@@ '@@ s track and field ath@@ let@@ es@@ .
After an attempt to deceive a doping check in the Olympic vil@@ lage@@ , Kenya has sent one coach home@@ .
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the cas@@ e.
A Kenyan official announced that former sprin@@ ter and current coach John An@@ z@@ rah had given a ur@@ ine sample in the Olympic village in the name of 800@@ -@@ metre runner Fer@@ gus@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch.
Ken@@ ya@@ '@@ s team managers were allegedly informed of this by the doping offici@@ al@@ s.
The global IA@@ AF federation has requested information about the matter from the IOC so it can carry out its own investig@@ ations@@ , stated an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person@@ .
"@@ The IA@@ AF will perform an evalu@@ ation@@ , depending on the findings of the investigation and the steps taken by the IOC as a resul@@ t@@ ,@@ " said an IA@@ AF state@@ ment@@ .
"@@ He (@@ An@@ z@@ rah@@ ) went to the doping check and alleged that he was Fer@@ gus@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch@@ , handed in the sam@@ ple@@ , and signed for it@@ ,@@ " explained Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i@@ , Ken@@ ya@@ '@@ s Chef de Mission@@ .
He had the athle@@ te@@ '@@ s accreditation as given in the list of training checks for the World Anti@@ -@@ Doping Agen@@ cy@@ .
Fer@@ gus@@ on Ro@@ tich came fourth in the 800@@ -@@ metre race at the 2015 World Championships in Bei@@ j@@ ing@@ .
Four days previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ , the Head of the Kenyan track & field dele@@ g@@ ation@@ , Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch@@ , had been sent away from the Rio gam@@ es@@ .
He was alleged to have told sport@@ speople from his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for mon@@ ey@@ .
According to media re@@ por@@ ts@@ , he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Air@@ port@@ .
After numerous instances of dop@@ ing@@ , the IOC has been keeping a particularly close eye on Kenya for a whi@@ le@@ .
When the IOC announced that it would hold more than 2000 targeted doping checks in advance of the Rio gam@@ es@@ , it also announ@@ c@@ ed@@ , un@@ usu@@ all@@ y@@ , that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be examined particularly clo@@ sel@@ y@@ .
A@@ head of the summer games in Bra@@ z@@ il@@ , the World Anti@@ -@@ Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti@@ -@@ doping law and a functioning system of chec@@ ks@@ .
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
Fol@@ lowing th@@ is@@ , W@@ ADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti@@ -@@ doping measures comply with W@@ ADA rul@@ es@@ .
Running is a national sport in Ken@@ y@@ a.
The country@@ '@@ s track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 world championships in Bei@@ j@@ ing@@ .
In a series of telev@@ ised reports by AR@@ D@@ , the claim was made time and again that doping drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a mentality of cheating at sport@@ .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und has recently called for an investigation in Kenya to mirror that which took place into Russian athle@@ tic@@ s.
This investigation proved that doping was undertaken extensively and systematically across the sport@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , Russi@@ a@@ '@@ s track and field athletes were banned from the summer gam@@ es@@ .

A musical has gri@@ pped Salz@@ burg@@ : Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein@@ '@@ s master@@ piec@@ e@@ , "@@ West Side Stor@@ y@@ "@@ .
Artistic Director Cecilia Bartol@@ i wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music@@ , and has made a childhood dream come true by taking on the role of Mari@@ a.
In the orchestra pit@@ , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra will be conducted by Venezuelan director Gusta@@ vo Du@@ dam@@ el@@ : "@@ This music is full of rhyth@@ m@@ ,@@ " he enth@@ us@@ es@@ .
We always say that it has a lot of Latin American influ@@ en@@ ces@@ .
There are many Latin American elements in its tempo and melo@@ dies@@ .
It is a wonderful mix@@ ture@@ , the perfect formula for our orchest@@ ra@@ .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein@@ '@@ s music in our blood@@ !
In this produc@@ tion@@ , Bartol@@ i plays an older Mari@@ a.
She remembers her love affair with Tony with wi@@ st@@ ful@@ ness@@ , while the younger Maria plays and dan@@ ces@@ .
The role of Maria has always fascinated me@@ .
Fir@@ stly because it@@ '@@ s musi@@ cally un@@ usu@@ al@@ !

As she says in her song@@ : "@@ I feel pre@@ tt@@ y@@ , oh so pre@@ tt@@ y@@ , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bri@@ ght@@ "@@ .
So she@@ '@@ s cle@@ ver@@ , and naive of cour@@ se@@ , and full of passion@@ .
"@@ She@@ '@@ s very like me@@ , like my Italian personality as a girl from Rom@@ e@@ ,@@ " lau@@ ghs Bar@@ to@@ li@@ .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera sin@@ ger@@ : "@@ Cecilia is a wonderful arti@@ st@@ .@@ "
We are so honoured to work with her@@ .
She is an incredibly generous person@@ .
And Bartol@@ i returns the compli@@ ment@@ : "@@ Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and so passion@@ ate@@ !@@ "
For him@@ , conducting is a need@@ .
You see it in all his mo@@ ve@@ ments@@ , his glan@@ ces - it is his life@@ !
It is such a great chance to be able to share this musical experience with hi@@ m.
We both have a rather southern temper@@ a@@ ment@@ , fire@@ , passion@@ , and we both approach life with joy@@ , which is the most important of all@@ !
For the American director Philip W@@ m. McKin@@ ley@@ , "@@ West Side Stor@@ y@@ " is bang up@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ date@@ : "@@ This work is all about prejudice and fanati@@ c@@ ism@@ .@@ "
Today we@@ '@@ re dealing with the refuge@@ es@@ , back then Puerto Ric@@ ans had gone to New Yor@@ k@@ , and the residents of New York did@@ n@@ '@@ t want them there@@ .
It@@ '@@ s the same issu@@ es@@ , and they were as significant then as they are to@@ day@@ .

Rei@@ d says Clinton will stick with Gar@@ land as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Rei@@ d says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land to the Supreme Court if she is elected pre@@ sident@@ .
Senate Republicans have blocked Gar@@ land@@ '@@ s confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March@@ .
Senate Maj@@ ority Leader Mitch Mc@@ Connell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Anton@@ in Sc@@ ali@@ a.

Tur@@ key@@ : Kurdish community faces mass exodus
"@@ If you don@@ '@@ t change your tune and praise Erdo@@ gan@@ , your suit@@ case is basically pack@@ ed@@ ,@@ " says the President of the Gü@@ len@@ -@@ supporting Dialogue and World found@@ ation@@ , Er@@ can Kar@@ ako@@ y@@ un@@ .
The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection@@ , fleeing from Turkey to German@@ y@@ .
In the medium ter@@ m@@ , this could even grow to "@@ a few hundred thous@@ and@@ "@@ , believes Ali Top@@ rak@@ , President of the associ@@ ation@@ .
The crackdown insti@@ gated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to German@@ y@@ .
"@@ In the short term I@@ '@@ m expecting ten thous@@ and@@ , in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in German@@ y@@ , if the Erdogan regime continues to antagon@@ ise minorities and democratic opposition@@ ,@@ " said the President of the Associ@@ ation@@ , Ali Top@@ rak@@ , to "@@ Die Welt@@ " newspaper on Fri@@ day@@ .
A few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds - and as a resul@@ t@@ , 500,000 Kurds are already on the run within Tur@@ key@@ .
After the unsuccessful coup@@ , secular and op@@ positional ethnic Turks have been added to the list@@ .
Many will want to seek a new start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Tur@@ key@@ .
"@@ It is unacceptable that a country that takes in refugees is also producing them@@ ,@@ " said Top@@ rak@@ .
The head of the Association complained about the deliberate relocating of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and A@@ lev@@ i town@@ s.
He thinks that Erdogan did this to encourage the remaining Kurds to leav@@ e.
"@@ They are the last big minority in Tur@@ key@@ : the Christian Armen@@ ians and the Greeks have already been ex@@ terminated or driven out over the past hundred year@@ s@@ ,@@ " said Top@@ rak@@ , who is also a member of the CD@@ U.
The head of the Association requested that the Federal Government acted "@@ as har@@ shly as Austria against Erdogan and his suppor@@ ters@@ "@@ .
A "@@ wit@@ ch@@ -@@ hun@@ t@@ " is also underway in Germany against those critical of Erdo@@ gan@@ .
Over the past few mon@@ th@@ s@@ , I have no longer felt safe in Germany for the first time@@ .
The German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears that many Turks will flee ab@@ road@@ .
More Turks will seek asylum in German@@ y@@ , especially Kurds and members of the opposition@@ .
B@@ eing singled out as a Gü@@ len@@ -@@ supporter is care@@ er@@ -@@ destroying for teachers and other acade@@ mic@@ s.
"@@ If you don@@ '@@ t change your tune and praise Erdo@@ gan@@ , your suit@@ case is basically pack@@ ed@@ ,@@ " said the President of the Gü@@ len@@ -@@ supporting Dialogue and World Fo@@ und@@ ation@@ , Er@@ can Kar@@ ako@@ y@@ un@@ , to "@@ Die Welt@@ " newsp@@ aper@@ .
As the newspaper re@@ por@@ ts@@ , using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Inter@@ i@@ or@@ , even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of political persec@@ u@@ tion@@ .
On the reference date of June 30@@ , this amounted to 11,@@ 386 pe@@ op@@ le@@ , almost 29 percent of all people entitled to asylum (@@ 39,@@ 6@@ 25@@ )@@ .
These figures do not include people who have fled war@@ , poverty or a lack of prospec@@ ts@@ .
Under the constitu@@ tion@@ , only individuals suffering political persec@@ u@@ tion@@ , i@@ .e@@ .@@ , on the part of the state@@ , are entitled to asyl@@ um@@ .




Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern@@ : "@@ Go where it hur@@ ts@@ "
St@@ range Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern@@ : Loc@@ als hear nothing about the summer elections - and holiday@@ makers from North Rhin@@ e@@ -@@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parlia@@ ment@@ .
In Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern@@ , they understood th@@ is@@ .
In 2021 the state parliament elections will not take place at the end of the summer holi@@ da@@ ys@@ , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided at the start of the year@@ .
The way things had been going was simply ridicul@@ ous@@ : summer holi@@ da@@ ys@@ , heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one an@@ other@@ .
The locals who need to be won over by the candidates are on holiday@@ .
Most holiday@@ makers in the state@@ , in U@@ se@@ dom@@ , Rü@@ gen or Hi@@ dden@@ see@@ , are not locals - and are not allowed to vote for the state parlia@@ ment@@ .
There are also practical problems to consider@@ : during the holi@@ da@@ ys@@ , volunteers who put up sign@@ s@@ , blow up ballo@@ ons@@ , distribute flyers and count the votes at the end@@ , are hard to fin@@ d.
Un@@ til 4 September 201@@ 6@@ , election day and the last day of the holi@@ da@@ ys@@ , people in Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vorpommern must put up with one more election without the people being consul@@ te@@ d.
The heated ph@@ ase@@ , if that can be said at all@@ , has already beg@@ un@@ .
And there@@ '@@ s something at sta@@ ke@@ : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ er@@ ing@@ , leader of an SP@@ D@@ /@@ CDU co@@ ali@@ tion@@ , is fearing for his se@@ at@@ .
The SP@@ D@@ , the strongest party since 199@@ 8@@ , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U@@ , according to poll@@ s.
It will be exciting to see how Neul@@ ing Af@@ D car@@ ves things up@@ , and whether a coalition can be formed with what@@ '@@ s left at the end@@ .
Sell@@ er@@ ing@@ , 66 years old and head of the parliament since 200@@ 8@@ , pursued a rather in@@ conspicuous election campaign@@ , as can be seen from his po@@ ster@@ s.
He is travelling around the region@@ , distributing roses and chatting a bit with pe@@ op@@ le@@ , just as his legen@@ dar@@ ily tac@@ it@@ urn predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff di@@ d.
Apart from th@@ at@@ , Seel@@ ering has got cold fe@@ et@@ , blaming Chancellor Merkel for the rise of the Af@@ D.
Her refugee poli@@ ci@@ es@@ , her "@@ we can manage it@@ " have accelerated the rise of the far@@ -@@ right@@ , he believes - which will probably cost him his job@@ .
The CDU and its top@@ -@@ level candi@@ date@@ , Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caff@@ ier@@ , has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time@@ .
The CDU have invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to two mass r@@ alli@@ es@@ ; Merk@@ el@@ '@@ s parliamentary constituency is in the north@@ -@@ east@@ .
But the target group was@@ n@@ '@@ t right@@ : there were more people from North Rhin@@ e@@ -@@ Westpha@@ lia@@ , Berlin and Saxony there than people from Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern@@ .
"@@ The majority probably came from other federal states@@ ,@@ " Vincent Ko@@ ker@@ t@@ , general secretary of the CDU in Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern@@ , complained to the N@@ DR rec@@ ent@@ ly@@ .
But it won@@ '@@ t do any harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merk@@ al for on@@ ce@@ .
Apart from th@@ at@@ , the north@@ -@@ east CDU is generally dispens@@ ing with the normal election events with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons in market squares and outside shopping cent@@ res@@ .
According to Ko@@ ker@@ t@@ , that will only play a "@@ minor ro@@ le@@ "@@ .
The Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region@@ , and will have to work hard to connect with the pe@@ op@@ le@@ .
They are suffering like the Le@@ ft@@ , the SP@@ D@@ , the Gre@@ ens@@ : hardly present across large swa@@ thes of the region@@ .
The advice that CDU candidate Kok@@ ert gave to his competitors is reve@@ al@@ ing@@ : "@@ You have got to go where it hur@@ ts@@ , or where the people are@@ : village fet@@ es@@ , Golden Wedding anni@@ vers@@ ari@@ es@@ , you have to make use of every birthday part@@ y.@@ "
Sell@@ ering has already called his SPD to fight a particularly committed election campaign because there is so much at sta@@ ke@@ .
According to poll@@ s@@ , the social democrats have 22 percent@@ , behind their partners the CDU (@@ 25@@ )@@ , and only frac@@ tionally ahead of the Af@@ D (@@ 19@@ )@@ .
In the 2011 elec@@ tions@@ , the SPD had a clear victory over the CDU (@@ 3@@ 5.6 percent versus 22 percent@@ )@@ .
The Gre@@ ens@@ , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s@@ , should make the leap into the regional parlia@@ ment@@ .
They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday issu@@ e@@ , and are waging their election war predominantly on@@ line@@ .
"@@ Online election campaign@@ " is what the regional chair@@ person Claudia Müller has dubbed it@@ .
Apart from th@@ at@@ , the Greens are searching out local voters among the holiday@@ ma@@ ker@@ s.
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek@@ , their top candi@@ date@@ , is currently crossing Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ '@@ s lakes on a house@@ boat - and is having a nice time@@ .
Her view@@ ? "@@ Hav@@ ing an election holiday in Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vorpommern is@@ n@@ '@@ t all that bad@@ "@@ .




B@@ 27 re@@ develop@@ ment@@ : restaurants are suffering from the closure
There are hardly any problems with the speed at which the B@@ 27 is being re@@ develop@@ ed@@ .
There is praise from all quarters for the people responsible for the construction work@@ s@@ , which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m.
"@@ They have done everything so speedi@@ ly@@ ,@@ " El@@ vira Tex@@ la@@ ff at the Jet petrol station expla@@ ins@@ .
That is a super team@@ .
There are also no del@@ ay@@ s.
At the start of the week@@ , the construction site could be moved south@@ wards in line with plan@@ s@@ , marking the half@@ -@@ way poin@@ t@@ , and everything is expected to be completed by Oc@@ tober@@ .
The oblig@@ ing@@ ness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute dri@@ ve@@ wa@@ ys@@ .
Since the construction site was moved south@@ wards on Mon@@ day@@ , and the A@@ spe@@ g@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen was re@@ open@@ ed@@ , and the link to Rot@@ tenburg was re@@ -@@ establish@@ ed@@ , the traffic situation within the town has impro@@ ved@@ .
Residen@@ ts can now drive on both sides of the B 27 out of Of@@ ter@@ din@@ gen@@ .
There seem to be fewer drivers taking alternative routes through the town@@ .
"@@ There were some serious complaints ma@@ de@@ ,@@ " said Florian King@@ , deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the re@@ develop@@ ment@@ .
Residen@@ ts in Bach@@ satz@@ stra@@ ß@@ e@@ , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e@@ , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to put up with more traffic noise because people were looking for ways to cut through@@ , trusting their sat@@ na@@ v more than the sign@@ age@@ .
This led to some lorries hur@@ tling through residential are@@ as@@ .
The commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen because speed limits were not always adhered to ei@@ ther@@ .
"@@ There were considerable infrin@@ ge@@ ments@@ ,@@ " said King@@ , who had taken a look on@@ -@@ site to see what was going on@@ .
Two to three vehicles were sn@@ apped by a speed camera every minu@@ te@@ .
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 z@@ one@@ .
Since the construction site has moved on@@ , things have quiet@@ ened down@@ .
This is only a small con@@ solation for businesses located along the B 27 that the road has reopened for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ bur@@ g.
Business people don@@ '@@ t like to show their hand@@ .
But nobody we questioned hid the fact that the B 27 re@@ development had led to a drop in profit@@ s.
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , some have been affected more than other@@ s.
People who have little to do with "@@ end custom@@ ers@@ "@@ , i.e. if they make products for other compani@@ es@@ , have hardly been affected by the re@@ develop@@ ment@@ .
Even at the Ma@@ ier car deal@@ er@@ ship@@ , Thomas Sul@@ z talked of "@@ a slight lo@@ ss@@ , at the mo@@ st@@ "@@ , but also admitted that "@@ there had been a lack of passing trade@@ "@@ .
Bars and restaurants along the road had been the hardest hit@@ .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner@@ , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house (@@ previously Kron@@ e@@ )@@ , expressed himself cle@@ ar@@ ly@@ .
It has threatened our very exist@@ ence@@ .
It@@ '@@ s not just him@@ : all restaurants have been "@@ hit hard@@ "@@ .
Customers from He@@ chin@@ gen@@ , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil stayed awa@@ y@@ .
We have to be happy about every euro of profit we make@@ .
He reck@@ ons that profits s@@ lum@@ ped by "@@ far more than 50 percent@@ "@@ .
The road re@@ development "@@ set back@@ " his businesses "@@ by two year@@ s@@ "@@ .
He had to let half of his staff go@@ .
If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go@@ , politicians would have reacted differ@@ ent@@ ly@@ .
In@@ stead@@ , when G@@ öh@@ ner asked the govern@@ ment@@ '@@ s pre@@ sident@@ , Jörg Schmid@@ t@@ , if there would be financial compens@@ ation@@ , the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the re@@ develop@@ ment@@ .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other districts where people have acted more gener@@ ous@@ ly@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite all the compla@@ ins@@ , G@@ öh@@ ner is convinced that his restaurant will survi@@ ve@@ .
After all@@ , the family business moved there back in 17@@ 15@@ , he sa@@ id@@ , referring to its long histor@@ y@@ .
He can understand that his regular customers visit less as a result of the complicated traffic system@@ .
If you can@@ '@@ t drive past@@ , other places are also ni@@ ce@@ .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regul@@ ars will return once the re@@ development works have been comple@@ te@@ d.
Des@@ p@@ ite the crises with BSE and bird flu@@ , G@@ öh@@ ner believes that the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele mark the biggest crisis his restaurant has suffered in its long histor@@ y@@ .
Six months of construction work@@ s@@ , th@@ at@@ '@@ s brut@@ al@@ .




Law are constantly being passed in the name of anti@@ -@@ terror@@ ism@@ .
After the most recent attack@@ s@@ , Minister of the Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now putting forward a host of security measu@@ res@@ .
But what does residential status have to do with terror@@ ism@@ ?
And what does the coalition partner have to say about it all@@ ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is playing the concili@@ ator@@ .
All his proposals are "@@ politically reason@@ able@@ " for the coalition partner@@ , the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security pack@@ age@@ .
They are not asking too much of any@@ one@@ .
O@@ ther@@ , more wi@@ de@@ -@@ reaching issues will first be discussed within the parti@@ es@@ .
I will also be involved in th@@ at@@ .
As Minister of the Inter@@ i@@ or@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , he is responsible for resul@@ ts@@ , and for reaching an "@@ achievable agre@@ e@@ ment@@ " within the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ , he sa@@ ys@@ .
After the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach@@ , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within German@@ y@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , they are more comprehensive as a resul@@ t.
One thing was already kno@@ wn@@ , announ@@ c@@ ed@@ , heral@@ de@@ d@@ : The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new@@ .
N@@ either is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun law@@ s.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a sur@@ pris@@ e.
To some ex@@ tent@@ , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with@@ : He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist group@@ s@@ , and remove German passports from ji@@ ha@@ dis with dual citiz@@ ens@@ hi@@ p.
"@@ They will be difficult issues for the SP@@ D@@ ,@@ " admitted the CDU politi@@ ci@@ an@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite th@@ is@@ , he believes they are achie@@ v@@ able@@ , and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner@@ .
De Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presented a few new ide@@ as@@ .
Some of them have a lot to offer@@ : He is planning accelerated processes for deportation and more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deport@@ ation@@ .
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smart@@ phones to be check@@ ed@@ , and present their social media accounts for security chec@@ ks@@ .
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit cri@@ mes@@ , or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identi@@ ty@@ .
Some of it is politically and legally trick@@ y@@ .
Some of it also seems half@@ -@@ bak@@ ed@@ , and leaves questions to be answer@@ ed@@ .
And for some points - such as the unequal treatment of tolerated persons - the following question is rais@@ ed@@ : What does that actually have to do with security and terror@@ ism@@ ?
Y@@ es@@ , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère sa@@ ys@@ , it is important to differentiate between the issues posed by refuge@@ es@@ , and the issue of terror@@ ism@@ .
But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refuge@@ es@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refuge@@ es@@ .
And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season@@ .
Domestic security has come to the fore to a huge ex@@ tent@@ .
First the attacks in neighbouring coun@@ tri@@ es@@ : Par@@ is@@ , C@@ openha@@ gen@@ , Br@@ ussel@@ s@@ , Nic@@ e.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach@@ .
There is a large amount of un@@ certain@@ ty@@ .
And y@@ es@@ , elections are lo@@ om@@ ing@@ .
The Union and the SPD are consequently focusing more and more on the issue of secur@@ ity@@ .
Over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parti@@ es@@ .
First a nasty argument about the Federal Police For@@ ce@@ '@@ s equip@@ ment@@ , then about an ide@@ as@@ -@@ gathering event for security and politic@@ s@@ -@@ related discussions between some Ministers of the Interior in the Union@@ , at which a bur@@ ka ban and the ren@@ unciation of dual citizenship were demanded by department head@@ s.
De Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also trying to strike a concili@@ atory note here@@ .
He does not think that dual citizenship will be remo@@ ved@@ .
We have dealt with the discussions in German@@ y@@ .
It would not make sense to reopen discussions on this topic@@ .
And he thinks that a bur@@ ka ban would come up against constitutional issu@@ es@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution through@@ out@@ , and whether it really is "@@ achie@@ v@@ able@@ " for his coalition partner@@ .
There are few things inside it that could cause problem@@ s.
But the SPD is also currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape it@@ sel@@ f.
SPD Head Sig@@ mar Gabriel showed that the party was happy to discuss the issu@@ e@@ , albeit sensi@@ tively at fir@@ st@@ , saying that "@@ the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further@@ .@@ "




Volkswagen gets off light@@ ly@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite the diesel scandal@@ , global delivery figures are increas@@ ing@@ .
But things ar@@ en@@ '@@ t quite as ro@@ sy in all market@@ s.
The recall has led to fuss about one ter@@ m.
Volks@@ wagen@@ '@@ s deliveries were more restrained in the second half of the year@@ .
Thanks to its number of brands and some well@@ -@@ functioning market@@ s@@ , Europe@@ '@@ s largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year@@ , despite the diesel scandal@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , in J@@ ul@@ y@@ , the VW core brand suffer@@ ed@@ , particularly in Western Europe@@ , thereby affecting overall sales@@ , as the Da@@ x@@ -@@ listed company announ@@ c@@ ed@@ .
Glob@@ all@@ y@@ , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9,@@ 100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year@@ .
In Western Europe al@@ one@@ , the second most important market after Chin@@ a@@ , sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month the year before@@ .
In its home market of German@@ y@@ , deliveries plum@@ meted by almost a six@@ th@@ .
Head of brand sales@@ , Jür@@ ge St@@ ack@@ mann@@ , blamed J@@ ul@@ y@@ '@@ s poor figures on the loss of two sales days in Europe@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , some key markets saw "@@ changed economic cli@@ mat@@ es@@ "@@ , which led to fewer purch@@ as@@ es@@ .
In addition to the situation regarding the attempted coup in Tur@@ key@@ , the British vote to leave the EU had also had an imp@@ act@@ , a spokes@@ woman sa@@ i@@ d.
In the US@@ A@@ , where the emissions scandal first began@@ , the books are once again in the re@@ d.
The Chinese market is a source of great support for V@@ W.
In tot@@ al@@ , Lower Sax@@ ony@@ '@@ s own brand@@ , which was most affec@@ ted@@ , has got off lightly from the diesel scandal@@ : After the first seven mon@@ th@@ s@@ , there is a minus in the books for deliveries amounting to 0.9 percent of 3.@@ 37 million vehi@@ cl@@ es@@ .
Head of sales at the comp@@ any@@ , Fred Kap@@ pl@@ er@@ , was once again able to bring out an increase in sales from January to J@@ ul@@ y@@ .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time peri@@ od@@ , coming to a global total of 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million@@ .
Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions test@@ s.
In Germany al@@ one@@ , VW has called 2.5 million vehicles back to workshops to be ref@@ it@@ te@@ d.
In the course of modifying the vehicles VW emphasised that ref@@ itting them would have no negative effec@@ ts@@ .
After the vehicles have been modi@@ fi@@ ed@@ , fuel consu@@ mp@@ tion@@ , CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get wor@@ se@@ .
After modific@@ ation@@ , the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "@@ as good as a guarante@@ e@@ " but would not talk of an actual "@@ guarante@@ e@@ "@@ , as was mentioned on Friday in corporate cir@@ cl@@ es@@ .
Legal intri@@ c@@ acies are the reason for th@@ is@@ .
"@@ Foc@@ us@@ " reported that Volkswagen would provide its German customers with a guarantee for modified diesel cars non@@ eth@@ el@@ ess@@ .
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on the Monday previ@@ ous@@ .
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken plac@@ e.
"@@ VW must fully meet the requirements of my investigative committee and the KB@@ A.@@ "
"@@ De@@ vi@@ ations will not be accep@@ ted@@ ,@@ " explained Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt (@@ CD@@ U@@ )@@ , the Federal Minister for Transport@@ , according to the Mini@@ str@@ y@@ .
VW took on the guarantee that fuel consu@@ mp@@ tion@@ , CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse as a result of the modific@@ ation@@ , and all vehicle values relevant to type approval would remain un@@ change@@ d.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "@@ guarante@@ e@@ "@@ , as has been mentioned in corporate cir@@ cl@@ es@@ .
Volkswagen believes that the broad term "@@ guarante@@ e@@ " could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the new software@@ , even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it@@ .
It is also in the custom@@ ers@@ ' interest to prevent confusion with guarantee clauses for any other faults that have nothing at all to do with the emissions scandal@@ .
This is why VW will not be using the term "@@ guarante@@ e@@ "@@ .




The Raff@@ eisen Bank in G@@ mund am Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see will demand penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so@@ .
Managing Director of the bank@@ , Josef Paul@@ , said on Thursday that "@@ this only applies to 139 customers with 40 million euros in their current accounts or day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day accoun@@ ts@@ "@@ .
The Federal Association of German Banks believes this is an isolated cas@@ e@@ , and does not see it as a sign@@ : normal savers "@@ need not worry about being hit with penalty interest on the pen@@ nies the@@ y@@ '@@ ve put asi@@ de@@ "@@ .
If banks invest money overnight with the European Central Bank (@@ EC@@ B@@ )@@ , they have to pay penalty interest of 0.4 percent@@ .
From Sept@@ ember@@ , the Raff@@ eisen Bank in G@@ mund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day account to pay this fe@@ e.
"@@ The first 100,000 euros are fre@@ e.@@ "
"@@ In the fut@@ ure@@ , any subsequent 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year@@ ,@@ " Paul sa@@ i@@ d.
For some time@@ , he has been managing 40 million euros that could be withdrawn any day@@ , and that he is unable to make use o@@ f.
"@@ The money has been sitting in my account at the Central Bank@@ , and costing 0.4 percent@@ ,@@ " the bank CEO sa@@ i@@ d.
"@@ I cannot put 4000 euros aside for every million@@ .@@ "
He is passing on the costs under the "@@ polluter pay@@ s@@ " prin@@ ci@@ ple@@ .
It would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raff@@ eisen Bank@@ '@@ s safe@@ : "@@ I have already been through four ra@@ id@@ s@@ , I don@@ '@@ t want a fif@@ th@@ !@@ " the bank@@ '@@ s managing director sa@@ i@@ d.
Most customers have been understand@@ ing@@ , and have switched to other forms of invest@@ ment@@ .
Only a small number moved to other ban@@ ks@@ .
The Federation of Co@@ operatives of Bavaria explained that "@@ the extreme monetary policy pursued by the EC@@ G leads to all banks incur@@ ring significant cost@@ s@@ "@@ .
It would be "@@ impos@@ si@@ ble@@ " for them to bear these costs "@@ on a permanent basi@@ s@@ , from a business per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ve@@ "@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , some German banks have increased the fees they charge for account management@@ , credit cards or transfer@@ s.
Thurin@@ gi@@ a@@ '@@ s "@@ Volks@@ - und Raff@@ eisen Bank@@ " in Alten@@ burger Land hit the headlines in 2014 when their Skat@@ bank branch imposed penalty interest on investments of more than three million euro@@ s.
Michael Kem@@ mer@@ , managing director of the banking associ@@ ation@@ , sa@@ id@@ : "@@ We are not expecting that private customers will all have to pay fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for th@@ at@@ "@@ .
A banker said th@@ at@@ , in Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see@@ , there was "@@ clientele who were rather better off in terms of ass@@ et@@ s.@@ "
"@@ That can be a problem for a small bank@@ ,@@ " if the bank is looking after their money for free@@ .
The Cooperative Bank of G@@ mund was founded in 19@@ 11@@ , and has branches in Bad Wies@@ see@@ , Rot@@ ta@@ ch@@ -@@ E@@ ger@@ n@@ , Kreu@@ th and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see@@ .
Fam@@ ous ac@@ tor@@ s@@ , sport@@ speople and enter@@ prene@@ urs live in the region@@ .
Spo@@ kes@@ person Ernst said that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "@@ was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their exp@@ ens@@ es@@ "@@ .
The President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Raiff@@ eisen@@ banken (@@ BV@@ R@@ )@@ , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich@@ , said at the end of June that "@@ the threshold for ti@@ pping into the red in terms of private customers is ver@@ y@@ , very high@@ "@@ .
Competition is fierc@@ e@@ , and there is the risk that investors will move to competi@@ tor@@ s.

It is not just an act of ho@@ arding by hob@@ by@@ ist@@ s@@ , either - it has emotional signific@@ ance@@ : older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (@@ 56@@ % versus 53@@ %@@ ) and enjoy being alone (@@ 69@@ % versus 66@@ %@@ )@@ .
But are You@@ Gov@@ '@@ s results tru@@ e@@ ?
If this blog was a telev@@ ised news re@@ port@@ , the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street@@ , wearing a modest grey suit and gest@@ uring wil@@ dly before stopp@@ ing@@ , cu@@ pping my hands and saying something authoritative like@@ : "@@ So@@ , let@@ '@@ s take a look@@ .@@ "
So@@ , let@@ '@@ s take a look@@ .
While the heart of Soho is slowly being dra@@ ined of its charm and gro@@ t - hot@@ els@@ , E@@ ats@@ , Prets and Pap@@ er@@ ch@@ ases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain@@ .
I@@ '@@ d probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit@@ , in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observ@@ ation@@ .
Glas@@ we@@ gian Stu@@ art@@ , 55@@ , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray (@@ data coun@@ t@@ : two young wom@@ en@@ , three mi@@ ddle@@ -@@ aged men@@ ) into Rec@@ kless Records (@@ data coun@@ t@@ : eight mi@@ ddle@@ -@@ aged men@@ , one wom@@ an@@ , probably in her 20@@ s@@ ) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is per@@ using the shops to fill a few hour@@ s.
Is he a collec@@ tor@@ , I as@@ k@@ ?
"@@ I suppose I am@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ ys@@ .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 record@@ s.
These record@@ s@@ , pic@@ tured above (@@ he em@@ ailed me the snap@@ , I did@@ n@@ '@@ t follow him home@@ )@@ , line his living room wall@@ s.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable in@@ com@@ e@@ : he is now able to buy records he cou@@ ld@@ n@@ '@@ t afford when they originally came out@@ , and to re@@ purchase items he sold when he was young and sk@@ int@@ .
"@@ A lot of the stuff I get is late 60@@ s@@ , early 70@@ s@@ , things that came out when I was 11 or 12@@ , things I was probably a bit too young to get@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ ys@@ .
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be intro@@ ver@@ ts who like their own comp@@ any@@ , ad@@ ding@@ : "@@ I don@@ '@@ t smo@@ ke@@ , I don@@ '@@ t drink very mu@@ ch.
It@@ '@@ s my vic@@ e.
We@@ z@@ , 25@@ , who works at Si@@ ster Ray@@ , also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the You@@ Go@@ v profi@@ le@@ .
He has@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hy@@ pe@@ , people who heard about the com@@ eback and felt compelled to buy back their old record@@ s.
From conversations I@@ '@@ ve had@@ , people have got rid of their collec@@ tion@@ , normally around 1998 or 199@@ 9.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ ys@@ .
That may explain a boom in vinyl revi@@ vali@@ sts of a certain age@@ .
But what about the alleged emotional importance of record@@ s@@ ?
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phon@@ ica to realise that record stores offer a comfor@@ ting community of lik@@ emin@@ ded typ@@ es@@ .
According to We@@ z@@ , some older customers have taken um@@ bra@@ ge with the contac@@ tless payment system in partic@@ ular@@ .
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sle@@ e@@ ve@@ , of items that recall hal@@ cy@@ on teenage mem@@ ori@@ es@@ .
"@@ I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort@@ ,@@ " We@@ z sa@@ ys@@ .
As a collector my@@ self@@ , I have th@@ at@@ , and I think a lot of people do@@ .
It@@ '@@ s an easy way to occupy your head@@ spac@@ e.
"@@ We@@ '@@ re like their social work@@ ers@@ !@@ " pipes up a co@@ -@@ worker from a stack of record@@ s.
An IC@@ M poll in April revealed that almost 50@@ % of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it@@ .
The poll also found that 4@@ 1@@ % have a turn@@ table they never use@@ , while 7@@ % of those who purchase vinyl don@@ '@@ t own a record play@@ er@@ .
At this stage of the news re@@ port@@ , I would probably be looking gra@@ vely concerned while fli@@ cking through a stack of bo@@ ssa nova comp@@ il@@ ations@@ .
The "@@ tro@@ phy@@ " aspect of the revival is something that J@@ onn@@ y@@ , 4@@ 2@@ , who works in Sounds of the Universe (@@ data coun@@ t@@ : three mid@@ de@@ -@@ aged men@@ ) has notic@@ ed@@ .
"@@ Some@@ one came in recently and sa@@ id@@ : "@@ I don@@ '@@ t have a record play@@ er@@ , but I want to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so we can put it on our shel@@ f@@ ,@@ "@@ " he sa@@ ys@@ .
That@@ '@@ s not a large percent@@ age@@ , but it@@ '@@ s definitely happ@@ en@@ ing@@ .
More of the product side@@ , less of the musi@@ c.
We have people say@@ ing@@ : "@@ I don@@ '@@ t have a record play@@ er.@@ "
That@@ '@@ s younger pe@@ op@@ le@@ , not older ones@@ , late teens who are just getting into it@@ .
F@@ opp@@ , which now dedic@@ ates almost an entire floor to vin@@ yl@@ , has a far more varied audience when I arri@@ ve@@ .
There are couples in their 70@@ s@@ , tourists taking phot@@ os@@ , teenage boys and mi@@ ddle@@ -@@ aged wom@@ en@@ .
While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Be@@ ast@@ '@@ s latest synth@@ - and sex@@ -@@ fuelled pop@@ , rather than no@@ od@@ ling j@@ azz@@ , is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its custom@@ er@@ s.
N@@ one of them look particularly lon@@ el@@ y@@ , but nag@@ ging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 secon@@ d@@ s.
E@@ lan@@ or@@ a@@ , 27@@ , has been walking around F@@ opp for a few min@@ ut@@ es@@ , looking at the variety of records on sal@@ e.
She is win@@ dow@@ -@@ shopp@@ ing@@ , rather than on a spending spre@@ e.
She do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t earn a lot@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ , so collecting records is@@ n@@ '@@ t really an option@@ .
It costs a lot@@ .
It@@ '@@ s easy to listen to music by a computer or another way@@ , but the beauty of vinyl is ..@@ .@@ " she dri@@ fts off into a lo@@ vest@@ ruck sigh@@ .
I don@@ '@@ t know how to explain - it@@ '@@ s really uniqu@@ e.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lo@@ vers@@ : Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters@@ .
While giving the illusion of per@@ using the den@@ im hot pan@@ ts@@ , I observe a group of teenage gir@@ ls@@ , who cluster around the Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras moment@@ ar@@ il@@ y@@ , before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Cros@@ ley record play@@ er@@ .
To the left is a stair@@ well@@ , a wall of which is st@@ acked with records by Ad@@ ele@@ , Jeff Buck@@ ley@@ , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac@@ : a mix of contemporary and classi@@ c@@ s@@ , the essential records for any average collec@@ tion@@ .
N@@ obo@@ dy is looking - perhaps because they are merely decor@@ ation@@ , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them@@ .
It is pure "@@ art vin@@ yl@@ .@@ "
But@@ , given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more@@ , there is little to complain ab@@ out@@ .
It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vin@@ yl@@ .
But while my findings suggest You@@ Gov@@ '@@ s results are accur@@ ate@@ , in Soho record stores at le@@ ast@@ , they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reali@@ ty@@ , in record shops and on online for@@ ums@@ .
These people are probably working hard at school or in offic@@ es@@ .
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings lo@@ it@@ ering around the record shops of Ber@@ wick Street@@ , fli@@ cking through records and avoiding the gaze of a cre@@ ep@@ y@@ , 30@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old fake television present@@ er who is looming over the shoulders of un@@ suspec@@ ting mi@@ ddle@@ -@@ aged men@@ .

French court rejects bid to demoli@@ sh shops at Jung@@ le refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demoli@@ sh dozens of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaurants in the Jung@@ le camp where thousands of refugees are liv@@ ing@@ .
At a court hearing this week@@ , Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shops where people inside the camp sell good@@ s@@ , from cigarettes to energy drin@@ ks@@ , offer hair@@ cut@@ s@@ , or sell tea for 50 cents (@@ 40@@ p@@ ) or basic meals for a few euros in ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft restauran@@ ts@@ .
The Calais pre@@ fec@@ t@@ '@@ s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax@@ , and because they carried fire and sanitation ris@@ ks@@ .
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vit@@ al@@ , saying the free meals offered by a state@@ -@@ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp@@ .
They argued the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need@@ .
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for exp@@ elling the people running the 72 ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shop@@ s@@ , but said the Calais pre@@ fec@@ t@@ '@@ s concerns "@@ were totally understand@@ able.@@ "
The jud@@ ge@@ , Jean@@ -@@ François Mol@@ la@@ , said the gro@@ c@@ eri@@ es@@ , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "@@ live in extremely precarious condi@@ tions@@ .@@ "
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunte@@ er@@ s.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp@@ '@@ s Jung@@ le Book Kid@@ s@@ " Cafe which is run not@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ profit and provides 200 meals a day@@ , English and French class@@ es@@ , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp@@ .
More than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed a petition to protect the ki@@ ds@@ " caf@@ e.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "@@ would be a catastrophe for these chil@@ dren@@ , some of whom are as young as ei@@ ght@@ .@@ "
Two ch@@ ari@@ ti@@ es@@ , Help Refugees and L@@ '@@ Auberge des Migran@@ ts@@ , on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jung@@ le camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer@@ .

Here comes the enforcement trailer
German@@ y@@ '@@ s spee@@ ders will have to get used to the new generation of speed@@ om@@ e@@ ters@@ : In various federal states@@ , including Hesse and Branden@@ burg@@ , new speed cameras are being tri@@ alle@@ d@@ , which are supposed to be particularly effective at catching those who drive too fast@@ .
The futur@@ istic@@ -@@ looking enforcement trailer made by Vit@@ ron@@ ic@@ , a company form Wies@@ ba@@ den@@ , could be used at accident black@@ spo@@ ts@@ , for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , where it is too dangerous for the police to go@@ .
For ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , road@@ works on a motor@@ way@@ , or a bridge that is due to be rep@@ ai@@ red@@ , and therefore has a temporary speed limit often lack the infrastructure to support a fixed speed camera to ensure that speed limits are being adhered to@@ .
It can also be too dangerous or expensive to keep assembling and un@@ assembling the speed camera at these poin@@ ts@@ .
The enforcement trailer is autonom@@ ous@@ : its battery lasts for five days of continuous measu@@ re@@ ment@@ , and data is transferred in encrypted form via a mo@@ dem@@ .
Thanks to laser measuring technolo@@ gy@@ , all vehicles across several lanes can be tracked at the same time@@ .
Variable speed limits and driving bans based on time@@ , lane or vehicle type can also be monit@@ ore@@ d.
When powered up@@ , the manufacturer says that any car with a trailer coupling can move the tra@@ il@@ er@@ .
To prevent it from simply being stol@@ en@@ , it sinks down when meas@@ ur@@ ing@@ , making its wheels disappear into the arm@@ ou@@ red@@ , bul@@ let@@ -@@ proof ex@@ teri@@ or@@ .

Since 201@@ 5@@ , according to Vit@@ ron@@ ic@@ , the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used in them@@ .
Foreign authorities are also using the new technology for speed cam@@ er@@ as@@ : recently France ordered 100 of them@@ , after ordering 150 the year before@@ .




Britain settle for silver in ru@@ gby se@@ vens after Fiji master@@ class sees them take gold
Great Brit@@ ain@@ '@@ s impressive run in the Rugby 7@@ s was brought to a cra@@ shing halt at the final hur@@ dle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43@@ -@@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Ri@@ o.
Fiji gave a master@@ class in hand@@ ling@@ , off@@ -@@ lo@@ ad@@ ing@@ , side@@ -@@ step@@ ping@@ , support play@@ , running lines and bru@@ te strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour@@ .
De@@ feat came with the non@@ -@@ too shab@@ by con@@ solation of silver - Brit@@ ain@@ '@@ s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7@@ s tournament in which they beat New Ze@@ al@@ and@@ , Argentina and South Africa along the way@@ .
The bru@@ ising beating of the B@@ ok@@ s@@ , 7@@ -@@ 5 in the semi@@ -@@ final earlier in the day@@ , may have come back to bite them in the fin@@ al@@ .
But@@ , regar@@ d@@ less@@ , Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fi@@ ddle 15@@ -@@ man team@@ .
It may be some con@@ solation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck tom@@ or@@ row@@ : Fi@@ ji@@ '@@ s head coach is Ben Ryan@@ , the former England boss from Wimble@@ don@@ .
It has been some journey for G@@ B.
Ei@@ ght years ago@@ , under Ryan@@ , they lost every game at the Adelaide Se@@ ven@@ s.
Her@@ e@@ , they lost just one@@ .
This hammer@@ ing will hurt but the progress is start@@ ling@@ .
Fiji started magnifi@@ cent@@ ly@@ , boun@@ cing off GB tackles for fun@@ .
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5@@ -@@ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au di@@ ved over in the cor@@ ner@@ .
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tu@@ wai added another down the right wing@@ , which was conver@@ te@@ d.
12@@ -@@ 0 and GB had hardly touched the ball@@ .
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man@@ -@@ mountain Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fi@@ ji@@ .
On seven minutes J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17@@ -@@ 0 to the bad@@ .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first hal@@ f.
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vou then burst through some more lim@@ p GB tackling and stor@@ med to the line to sco@@ re@@ .
The conversion made it 29@@ -@@ 0 at the break@@ .
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7@@ s@@ , while GB are still learning the trade@@ .
Which is pretty much how it is@@ .
GB made wholesale changes at half@@ -@@ time and they plugged the Fi@@ jian dam@@ ..@@ .@@ for all of four min@@ ut@@ es@@ , which by fir@@ st@@ -@@ half standards was good@@ , until Jo@@ sua Tu@@ is@@ ova went over after some brilliant Fi@@ jian inter@@ play@@ .
Dan Norton gra@@ bbed a try for GB@@ , touching down in the left corner to make it 36@@ -@@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Is@@ l@@ anders whose fans sang@@ , wa@@ ved flags and dan@@ ced in the stand@@ s.
It was hard not to admire Fi@@ ji@@ '@@ s whole joyful appro@@ ach@@ .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame iced the Fi@@ jian cake that did@@ n@@ '@@ t need icing with another try in the dying moment@@ s.
The whistle w@@ ent@@ , the Fi@@ ji@@ ans embraced and GB hit the tur@@ f@@ , thoroughly be@@ aten@@ .
Ear@@ lier in the day@@ , Fiji had beaten Japan 20@@ -@@ 5 in their semi@@ -@@ final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi@@ -@@ final of one try each - Brit@@ ain@@ '@@ s conversion the differen@@ ce@@ .
K@@ yle Brown put the Bo@@ ks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling foot@@ work broke the line and scored under the posts in the second hal@@ f.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Wat@@ son@@ , brother of Eng@@ land@@ '@@ s 15@@ -@@ aside team@@ , Anth@@ ony@@ , secured the win - and ultimately the silver med@@ al@@ .




Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired to rowing victory by co@@ ach@@ '@@ s cancer battle
There will not be a more emo@@ tive gold at these gam@@ es@@ , and that is saying some@@ th@@ ing@@ .
From the first stroke to the last@@ , 220 punishing heav@@ es into histor@@ y@@ , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ o@@ a.
Th@@ ough they were the two pulling on the o@@ ar@@ s@@ , there were three voices in that bo@@ at@@ , the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the wom@@ en@@ '@@ s pair@@ s@@ , the first females in the ann@@ als of British sport to scale such a hei@@ ght@@ .
Thei@@ r dominance was absolu@@ te@@ , after all this was their 39@@ th outing unbe@@ aten@@ , again unpreced@@ ent@@ ed@@ .
What we see@@ , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of s@@ wan@@ s@@ , does not wholly reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ .
Behin@@ d every rowing gold is a bat@@ tali@@ on of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the differen@@ ce@@ , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with can@@ cer@@ .
As he sa@@ id@@ , it was touch and go@@ .
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they di@@ d.
If they don@@ '@@ t it goes every@@ where@@ .
It would have been a pretty bad situ@@ ation@@ .
It alters your outlook a bit@@ .
Williams was diagnosed in December 201@@ 3.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season@@ , keeping the disruption to a minim@@ um@@ , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as th@@ es@@ e.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quick@@ ly@@ .
It was an inc@@ enti@@ ve@@ .
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20@@ ft@@ , 30@@ ft 50@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is en@@ ou@@ gh@@ .
That@@ '@@ s how it starts off@@ .
Ro@@ wing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit big@@ ger@@ .
In the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts were for Willi@@ am@@ s@@ , who had spent a ner@@ vy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anx@@ ie@@ ti@@ es@@ .
St@@ ann@@ ing@@ , a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her@@ , said "@@ I@@ '@@ ve been an emotional wreck this week@@ , maybe th@@ at@@ '@@ s a bit extre@@ me@@ , but it means such a lot@@ .@@ "
It just reiterates how much this means to me@@ , how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well@@ .
It@@ '@@ s been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Rob@@ in@@ .
Without Robin we would be no@@ body@@ , so a massive thanks to him he@@ '@@ s the best coach in the world@@ .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ '@@ t have asked for a better person to train with@@ , or a better co@@ ach@@ .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning ha@@ ven@@ '@@ t lost a race in five year@@ s.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never mat@@ ch.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to clo@@ se@@ , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reser@@ ve@@ .
We were very much in the moment@@ .
Helen was calling '@@ stay in the process@@ , stay in the process@@ '@@ .
It@@ '@@ s really important not to get carried awa@@ y@@ .
We had a good start and at the same time we wer@@ en@@ '@@ t looking to do anything amaz@@ ing@@ .
We wer@@ en@@ '@@ t looking for fireworks to@@ day@@ , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that ra@@ ce@@ , which we di@@ d.
The pair will take a year before deciding their fut@@ u@@ res@@ .
Glo@@ ver has a wedding to attend next mon@@ th@@ , her own to television advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ sh@@ all@@ .
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment@@ .
I did@@ n@@ '@@ t want to say this was my last ra@@ ce@@ .
That would have meant too much pres@@ su@@ re@@ .
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champi@@ on@@ .
It was all so new and I was so stre@@ sse@@ d.
Here it took about four min@@ ut@@ es@@ .
This feels so much better@@ ,@@ " she sa@@ i@@ d.




Set@@ ting a clear example for 31 years
The Managing Director of the "@@ V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ g@@ rup@@ pe@@ " Water Supply Associ@@ ation@@ , Rupert Gö@@ ll@@ er@@ , is reti@@ ring@@ .
The As@@ so@@ cation "@@ sets an example for the entirety of Bav@@ ari@@ a@@ "@@ .
A small Fran@@ conian drinking water supply association as a ro@@ le@@ -@@ model for the large water produc@@ er@@ s.
That was how the association was described in a segment on Bavarian radi@@ o.
A little later@@ , the Water Forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the Associ@@ ation@@ .
The V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ g@@ rup@@ pe@@ '@@ s work was described as "@@ setting an example for the entirety of Bav@@ ari@@ a@@ "@@ .
Rupert Gö@@ ller is behind it all@@ : he worked as an employee of the Association for 31 year@@ s@@ , and has been its Managing Director for 28.
He has now gone into retirement at the age of 6@@ 5.
The V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe Drin@@ king Water Supply Association has its headquarters in K@@ otten@@ dorf in the commune of Breit@@ brun@@ n@@ , and provides 150,000 cubic metres of water annu@@ all@@ y@@ , supplying 32 villages and ham@@ lets with around 5,@@ 500 inhabit@@ an@@ ts@@ .
The commun@@ es of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter@@ , Breit@@ brun@@ n@@ , Lau@@ ter@@ , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the municipality of Ba@@ un@@ ach are also member@@ s.
Water supply contracts are in place for additional municipalities and commun@@ es@@ .
Current chair@@ man@@ , Breit@@ brun@@ n@@ '@@ s ma@@ yo@@ ress Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l (@@ F@@ W@@ )@@ , looks back to when Rup@@ er Gö@@ ller was brought on as a water officer in 198@@ 5@@ , and was promoted to Managing Director of the Association as soon as 198@@ 8.
"@@ His tasks were very vari@@ ed@@ , ranging from constructing water pipes and performing maintenance work through to office and organisational tas@@ ks@@ , budget plann@@ ing@@ , calculating fees and contribu@@ tions@@ , through to getting involved in emergencies at week@@ end@@ s@@ ,@@ " the chairman sa@@ i@@ d.
She pointed out some exceptional success@@ es@@ , including commissioning and opening the new spring (@@ 199@@ 4@@ )@@ , purchasing land near the new spring (@@ 199@@ 8@@ )@@ , compensating far@@ mer@@ s@@ , renov@@ ating the elevated tanks (@@ 199@@ 9@@ )@@ , creating a new computer management system (@@ 2004@@ )@@ , and renewing some of the water pi@@ pes@@ .
Things never stopp@@ ed@@ , and renovations were always under@@ way@@ : water means life@@ , and drinking water is the most important foodstuff of all@@ .
In her lau@@ dat@@ ory spe@@ ech@@ , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ er@@ '@@ s loy@@ al@@ , reli@@ able@@ , and up@@ standing service over 31 year@@ s.
He put his heart and soul into the Water Supply Associ@@ ation@@ , and lived for it as if it were his own comp@@ any@@ .
A few weeks ago he gave a presentation at the Water Forum for the District of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia as a true practitioner of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ g@@ rup@@ pe@@ '@@ s successful nitrate reduction concep@@ t.
He received considerable appreciation and praise for th@@ is@@ .
For his part@@ , Rupert Gö@@ ller praised water officer Alf@@ ons G@@ rieb@@ el@@ , who had worked alongside him for 28 year@@ s.
He is the best water offic@@ er@@ , and he was a loyal la@@ d.

"@@ The man himself called up and admitted to having shot his partner@@ ,@@ " a police spokes@@ woman sa@@ i@@ d.
The perpetr@@ ator is on the run@@ , she sa@@ id@@ , and he is officially being sou@@ ght@@ .
This search is now happening across German@@ y@@ , because Sven S. might be travelling by car@@ .
The man is around 1.8 m tall@@ , mus@@ cul@@ ar@@ , sun@@ -@@ tan@@ ne@@ d@@ , and has a bald pat@@ ch.
The police have now issued a photo of hi@@ m.
But it is a couple of years ol@@ d.
The man now has a bald pat@@ ch.
The man should not be appro@@ ach@@ ed@@ .

Steel - There@@ '@@ s a ray of hope for the German steel industry
The German steel industry has been ri@@ ddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared additional costs that could have run into the milli@@ ons@@ .
The sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green ener@@ gy@@ , but these are now off the table@@ .
Federal Minister of the Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel (@@ SP@@ D@@ ) told the "@@ West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeit@@ ung@@ " (@@ W@@ AZ@@ ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self@@ -@@ supply for pre@@ -@@ existing plants within the German steel indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
"@@ I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negoti@@ ations@@ .@@ "
The European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufactur@@ ers@@ , who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use@@ , pay a lev@@ y@@ .
According to the German association for the sec@@ tor@@ , the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year@@ .
Gabriel told W@@ AZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission@@ , following discussions with Margrethe Vest@@ ager@@ , the Commissioner for Competi@@ tion@@ .
The EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steel@@ works are replac@@ ed@@ .
This too will not be levied against the steel indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement Germany had reached with the EU Commission on electricity self@@ -@@ gener@@ ation@@ .
The agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formali@@ se@@ d.
Gabri@@ el@@ '@@ s positive efforts are particularly important for the steel indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
"@@ It is the first step within our "@@ steel is the fut@@ ure@@ " campaign@@ .@@ "
"@@ This needs to be followed by other step@@ s.@@ "
"@@ Climate targets and employment objectives also need to be taken into account during negotiations to reform emissions allow@@ anc@@ es@@ ,@@ " explained IG Metall@@ '@@ s CE@@ O@@ , Jörg Hof@@ mann@@ , in Frankfur@@ t.
Since the financial crisis of 200@@ 8@@ , Europe@@ '@@ s steel sector has suffered from over@@ capacities and considerable pressure in terms of pric@@ ing@@ .
The situation only worsened over the past year when the world@@ ' biggest produc@@ er@@ , Chin@@ a@@ , dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic dem@@ and@@ .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dump@@ ing@@ .
The situation improved slightly during spring of this year@@ .
On the one hand@@ , import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel@@ , on the other@@ , economic prospects in China brigh@@ tened up@@ .
It is not clear how long prices will remain per@@ ked up for@@ .
The German sector lea@@ der@@ , Thyssen@@ k@@ rupp@@ , was cautious on Thurs@@ day@@ .
Prices had plate@@ au@@ ed rec@@ ent@@ ly@@ , he sa@@ i@@ d.
The sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further@@ .
Thyssen@@ k@@ rup@@ p also did not want to rule out closing individual plan@@ ts@@ .
At the end of 201@@ 5@@ , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in German@@ y@@ '@@ s steel indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite rising prices and increasing order@@ s@@ , German steel manufacturers remained cautious in J@@ ul@@ y@@ .
At 3.4 million t@@ ons@@ , they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year@@ , as the steel association reported on Fri@@ day@@ .
After a brief spi@@ ke in May@@ , the amounts produced shr@@ unk for a second consecutive mon@@ th@@ .
Since the start of the year@@ , production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year@@ .
The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months thanks to an improved situation in terms of order@@ s.




Commun@@ ity@@ , mind@@ , heal@@ th@@ : singing is good for the elderly
Sing@@ ing has been a constant throughout Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp@@ '@@ s entire life@@ : as a young girl she sang in her school cho@@ ir@@ , when she was studying to be a teacher she took music class@@ es@@ , and to@@ day@@ , the 78@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old sings in a choir for the el@@ der@@ ly@@ .
"@@ Sing@@ ing moves me - emotionally and physi@@ call@@ y@@ ,@@ " she descri@@ bes@@ .
After a rehear@@ sal@@ , she feels bal@@ anc@@ ed@@ , happ@@ y@@ , and generally more ali@@ ve@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ .
And addi@@ tion@@ all@@ y@@ , she@@ '@@ s doing something good for her health and her min@@ d.
Sing@@ ing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reason@@ s@@ , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Association for the El@@ der@@ ly@@ .
Most elderly people sing in a choir and share the enjoyment they get from music with like@@ -@@ minded pe@@ op@@ le@@ , says H@@ ac@@ kler@@ .
By regularly spending time with other@@ s@@ , the elderly can build and maintain social contac@@ ts@@ .
Social and famili@@ al structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other pe@@ op@@ le@@ .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also experienced this in her cho@@ ir@@ : "@@ Ar@@ ranging and organising things with pe@@ op@@ le@@ , being able to rely on others and learn from them - a choir is a really unique way of being together with other pe@@ op@@ le@@ "@@ .
Sing@@ ing can be demanding in the positive sen@@ se@@ , H@@ ac@@ kler thin@@ ks@@ .
This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a controlled man@@ ner@@ .
If you push your lungs to their limits regul@@ ar@@ ly@@ , you will not run out of breath as quickly in day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day life@@ .
And if you are interested in keeping the sound of your voice as you age@@ , to@@ o@@ , singing is the perfect hob@@ by@@ .
Sing@@ ing often has a really special effect on older pe@@ op@@ le@@ , says Ursula L@@ En@@ z from the German Association of Senior Citiz@@ ens@@ ' Associ@@ ations@@ .
For older gener@@ ations@@ , singing together is seen as more import@@ ant@@ , it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time@@ , she expla@@ ins@@ .
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in older people that are often connected to positive emotions from their you@@ th@@ .
Song tex@@ ts@@ , and melodies in partic@@ ular@@ , can even be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past@@ .
Sing@@ ing also demands particular mental exer@@ tion@@ , explains Lenz@@ .
Con@@ cent@@ rating on one@@ '@@ s own voice and a set rhyth@@ m@@ , while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challen@@ ge@@ .
In partic@@ ular@@ , older people who live alone can practice how to focus on people other than them@@ sel@@ ves@@ .
Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in a cho@@ ir@@ , H@@ ac@@ kler thin@@ ks@@ .
A happy audience is great pra@@ ise@@ .
Even one@@ '@@ s self@@ -@@ esteem is boosted by singing in a cho@@ ir@@ .
B@@ eing able to show yourself that by practising for a long time@@ , you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength@@ .
So there are enough good reasons to start sing@@ ing@@ .
If you want to try a new hob@@ by@@ , don@@ '@@ t delay - even if you think you@@ '@@ ve not got much tal@@ ent@@ , Lenz sug@@ gest@@ s.
You@@ '@@ re not singing by yourself - and in a group of 50 people sing@@ ing@@ , who@@ '@@ ll hear if a note@@ '@@ s out here or there@@ ?
The elderly have many options when looking for the right fit@@ , says H@@ ac@@ kler@@ .
If someone you know already sings in a choir for the el@@ der@@ ly@@ , you can just go along with them@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , many towns offer an overview of the cho@@ irs in their region@@ .
If you want to sing in a church cho@@ ir@@ , you can approach the parish or chur@@ ch@@ warden direc@@ t@@ ly@@ .
Many cho@@ irs for the elderly can also be found on@@ line@@ .
If you don@@ '@@ t have access to the internet@@ , you can ask your famil@@ y@@ , friends or neighbours to help you look things up on@@ line@@ .
If you@@ '@@ re interested in sing@@ ing@@ , you should absolutely join a cho@@ ir@@ , H@@ ac@@ kler thin@@ ks@@ .
Sing@@ ing is good for the soul and is a kind of release - no matter how old you are@@ .




Fem@@ ale cats react more sensi@@ tively than male cats to the me@@ wls of their kit@@ tens
Bi@@ ologists in Hanover have researched the effect kit@@ ten@@ s@@ ' cries have on adult anim@@ al@@ s.
To their sur@@ pris@@ e@@ , the mi@@ a@@ owing did@@ n@@ '@@ t leave the male cats unaffected - but@@ , compared to their female counter@@ par@@ ts@@ , they always acted the same way@@ .
Fem@@ ale cats can tell how agit@@ ated kit@@ tens are by their mi@@ a@@ ow@@ ing@@ .
They react ten percent quicker to kit@@ tens who sound to be in great di@@ stress@@ , the scientists from the Veterinary University and Medical University of Hanover discover@@ ed@@ .
Male cats do respond to kit@@ ten@@ s@@ ' cries - but always to the same ex@@ tent@@ .
"@@ It is clear that the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ao@@ ws of kit@@ tens that are more or less agit@@ aged are either im@@ perceptible or un@@ important for male c@@ ats@@ ,@@ " the biolo@@ gists Wieb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding@@ , from M@@ H@@ H@@ , sa@@ i@@ d.
She is the first author of the study published in the "@@ BM@@ C Evolu@@ tionary Bi@@ olo@@ gy@@ " specialist journal this Fri@@ day@@ .
In a previous experiment the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of a kit@@ ten@@ '@@ s mi@@ a@@ ow changes depending on how urgently they need hel@@ p.
Nine adult male cats and eight female cats from the M@@ H@@ H@@ '@@ s animal husbandry programme were exam@@ in@@ ed@@ .
First@@ ly@@ , they were played the sound of a kit@@ ten who had been taken from the bir@@ thing box and separated from its mother and si@@ bl@@ ings for three min@@ ut@@ es@@ .
Then they were played the sound of a more agit@@ ated cat@@ , which had also been lifted up@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite the low sample size@@ , the researchers believe the results to be signific@@ ant@@ .
"@@ All fem@@ al@@ es@@ , even those who did not have their off@@ spring@@ , were able to differentiate between mi@@ a@@ ow@@ s@@ ,@@ " said Kon@@ er@@ ding@@ .
They turned towards the speaker quicker if it was playing the sound of a highly agit@@ ated kit@@ ten@@ .
This ability may be inn@@ ate@@ , or may develop as the animal reaches sexual matur@@ ity@@ .
"@@ One surprise was that the male cats reacted at all@@ ,@@ " the biolo@@ gist sa@@ i@@ d.
In the past@@ , scientists have researched wom@@ en@@ '@@ s and men@@ '@@ s reactions to bab@@ i@@ es@@ ' cries on multiple occa@@ sions@@ .

Po@@ dol@@ ski and "@@ Gala@@ " are shooting for the Su@@ perc@@ up
H@@ akan Sü@@ kür is a football legend in Tur@@ key@@ .
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for the former football star H@@ akan Sü@@ kür@@ .
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist organis@@ ation@@ .
An important football match is taking place in Turkey for the first time following the attempted cou@@ p.
A@@ head of the du@@ el between arch@@ -@@ rivals Be@@ si@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lu@@ kas Po@@ dol@@ ski@@ '@@ s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Su@@ perc@@ up in Kon@@ ya@@ , the official line is cle@@ ar@@ : "@@ business as usu@@ al@@ "@@ .
Even when announcing the state of emergency after the attempted coup in J@@ ul@@ y@@ , the government emphasised that this would not affect citiz@@ ens@@ ' daily life@@ .
This does not apply to those people suspected of being followers of the ima@@ m F@@ eth@@ ulla Gü@@ len@@ , who is believed to be responsible for the attempted cou@@ p.
And this do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t stop for foot@@ ball@@ .
The state prosecutor has issued a warrant for the arrest of former star stri@@ ker H@@ akan Sü@@ kür@@ .
Sü@@ kür@@ , who now lives in Ameri@@ ca@@ , is accused of being a member of a terrorist organis@@ ation@@ .
Sü@@ kür is accused of being a fol@@ lower of the ima@@ m F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len@@ , whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds responsible for the attempted cou@@ p.
While the state of emer@@ gen@@ cy@@ , declared for ninety da@@ ys@@ , will continue until Oc@@ tober@@ , it is having practically no effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks@@ .
On Wedn@@ es@@ day@@ , Erdogan announced that the night@@ -@@ time "@@ democracy vigi@@ ls@@ " in public places across the country have come to an end@@ .
The sport - like the entire country - is divided into those who support Erdo@@ gan@@ , and those who do not@@ .
Fans of the work@@ ers@@ ' club Be@@ si@@ kt@@ as@@ , in partic@@ ular@@ , are not traditionally counted among the Pre@@ sident@@ '@@ s friend@@ s.
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the strict rejection of military cou@@ ps is what brings most Turks toge@@ ther@@ , in the light of dramatic historical event@@ s.
And even the fans can agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Be@@ si@@ kt@@ as@@ .
For cup winners Gala@@ , it will once again depend on Lu@@ kas Po@@ dol@@ ski@@ .
The Cologne native has proved his sporting value over the last season@@ : with 17 goals and nine assists across all competi@@ tions@@ , the 31@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old closed his first season as his club@@ '@@ s top scor@@ er@@ .
In the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce@@ , he scored the goal that led to a 1@@ -@@ 0 vic@@ tor@@ y@@ .
The "@@ Fan@@ ati@@ k@@ " newspaper praised him@@ , saying "@@ he was the best player on the pit@@ ch@@ .@@ "
He finished the season in sty@@ le@@ , and secured the cup for his team@@ .
Thanks to "@@ Pol@@ di@@ "@@ , the disappointing season for the record@@ -@@ holders came to a happy end@@ .
After their kno@@ ck@@ out in the he@@ ats for the Champions Le@@ ag@@ ue@@ , the "@@ Li@@ ons@@ " also left the Europa League early on@@ .
They only reached sixth place in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g.
The season was not goo@@ d.
The cup was the only chance to win some@@ th@@ ing@@ .
"@@ We did it - and th@@ at@@ '@@ s the most important th@@ ing@@ ,@@ " said Po@@ dol@@ ski@@ .
W@@ inners Be@@ si@@ kt@@ as saw a better year of play@@ .
This is mainly thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez@@ , who laid the groundwork for their four@@ teenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Sü@@ per Li@@ g@@ '@@ s star go@@ al@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ .
This is also why fans are hoping that the 31@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old re@@ turn@@ s.
Gom@@ ez@@ , under contract at AC Florenz and only on loan to Bes@@ kt@@ as@@ , announced after the attempted coup that he would not return to the country after his European Championship holiday due to the political situ@@ ation@@ .
"@@ But if Mario wants to come here@@ , all he has to do is say@@ ,@@ " "@@ Ki@@ cker@@ " specialist magazine quoted club chairman Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man as say@@ ing@@ .

Des@@ p@@ ite dop@@ ing@@ : These athletes are still in with a chance of winning medals in Rio
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin@@ , aged 34@@ , has already been banned twice for doping (@@ in 2001 and 200@@ 6@@ )@@ .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer Julia Ste@@ pan@@ o@@ wa is banned from taking her place on the start line@@ .
Other track athletes who have been found guilty can only laugh - they are in Rio competing for med@@ al@@ s.
The issue of doping continues to hit the headlines during the Olympic Games in Ri@@ o.
The Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa@@ , who appealed against her doping conviction shortly before the games to enable herself to compet@@ e@@ , was boo@@ ed and sh@@ outed at as she started her 100@@ -@@ metre breast@@ stroke ra@@ ce@@ .
It was a bizarre scen@@ e@@ : She wal@@ tz@@ ed into the pool with a smile pla@@ stered on her fac@@ e@@ , a deliberately provocative entran@@ ce@@ .
As it became clear that she would not take the gold med@@ al@@ , the audience che@@ ered enthusias@@ tic@@ all@@ y@@ .
But there are many other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past@@ .
Here is an over@@ view@@ :
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin (@@ 100@@ , 200@@ , 4x@@ 100m rela@@ y@@ /@@ US@@ A@@ )@@ : The 34@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old is one of the most controversial track ath@@ let@@ es@@ .
He has already been banned twice for doping (@@ in 2001 and from 2006 to 2010@@ )@@ .
Since being ban@@ ne@@ d@@ , the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion is running faster than ever before@@ : covering 100m in 9.@@ 80 secon@@ ds@@ , he is the world number one@@ , and is U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t@@ '@@ s major challen@@ ger@@ .
Sh@@ ell@@ y@@ -@@ Ann Fra@@ ser@@ -@@ Pr@@ y@@ ce (@@ 100@@ , 4x@@ 100m rela@@ y@@ /@@ Jama@@ ic@@ a@@ )@@ : The two@@ -@@ time Olympic champion and seven@@ -@@ time World Champion was handed a six@@ -@@ month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken Oxy@@ co@@ done@@ .
The 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad tooth@@ ache after an operation@@ .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic (@@ disc@@ us@@ /@@ Croati@@ a@@ )@@ : in 201@@ 1@@ , the 2012 Olympic Champ@@ tion@@ , 2013 World Champion and 2010@@ -@@ 2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant me@@ thy@@ h@@ exam@@ in@@ ine@@ .
Per@@ ko@@ vic said that she had not knowingly taken the dru@@ g@@ , and was banned for six mon@@ th@@ s.
This year@@ '@@ s four longest throws were by the woman ti@@ pped for gol@@ d.
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ rit (@@ 200@@ , 400 4x@@ 400m rela@@ y@@ /@@ US@@ A@@ )@@ : Champion at the Beijing Olympics and two@@ -@@ time 400m World Champi@@ on@@ , Mer@@ rit tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 mon@@ th@@ s.
Mer@@ ritt claimed that a penis enlargement drug was to bl@@ ame@@ .
This year@@ , the 30@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old is the fastest man in the world in the 200m and the 400@@ m.
Ivan Ti@@ chon (@@ hammer@@ , Belar@@ us@@ )@@ : There is hardly another athlete who has been retro@@ spec@@ tively stripped of so many med@@ al@@ s.
Ti@@ chon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after he was proved to have been involved in te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one dop@@ ing@@ .
Now 40 years old@@ , he was also stripped of his 2004 Olympic silver medal for doping with ster@@ o@@ id@@ s@@ , and his 2006 European Champion title for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one mis@@ use@@ .
His bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics was also taken awa@@ y@@ , but it was returned to him following a decision by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport@@ , CAS@@ .
With 8@@ 0.@@ 04@@ m he is at second place in the global rank@@ ing@@ s.
Liu Hong (@@ 20@@ km wal@@ king@@ , Chin@@ a@@ )@@ : The world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May@@ , but will still be on the start line in Ri@@ o.
The 29@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supple@@ ment@@ , but the World Anti@@ -@@ Doping Agency (@@ W@@ AD@@ A@@ )@@ '@@ s ban was leni@@ ent@@ , and ended as early as July 13.




Bom@@ b terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the wom@@ an@@ , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll@@ , the spokesperson for the Foreign Mini@@ str@@ y@@ , said early on Friday mor@@ ning@@ .
She has some cut@@ s@@ , he sa@@ ys@@ , and was treated in hosp@@ ital@@ , but has already been able to leave hosp@@ ital@@ .
She plans to return home at the start of Sept@@ ember@@ .
It is currently unclear whether other Austrian citizens have been affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket or in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani@@ , P@@ hang N@@ ga@@ , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ pon@@ .
According to Sch@@ nö@@ ll@@ , the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities as a resul@@ t.
Hua Hin@@ , located around 200 kilometres south of the capital city@@ , Bang@@ ko@@ k@@ , two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday even@@ ing@@ .
According to police re@@ por@@ ts@@ , a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people in@@ ju@@ red@@ , including the Austrian wom@@ an@@ , three German@@ s@@ , three people from Holland and three Itali@@ ans@@ .
There were another two explosions early on Friday mor@@ ning@@ , with another person kil@@ le@@ d@@ , according to the authori@@ ti@@ es@@ .
A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the mor@@ ning@@ .
Police reports state that a taxi driver was injured in the explo@@ sion@@ , which occurred near Pat@@ ong beach@@ , popular with holiday@@ ma@@ ker@@ s.
Another bomb exploded in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the country@@ '@@ s south@@ -@@ east coast@@ , which led to the death of a civil serv@@ ant@@ .
According to the authori@@ ti@@ es@@ , the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal poli@@ ce@@ '@@ s territ@@ or@@ y@@ .
Fin@@ all@@ y@@ , explosions in P@@ hang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ -@@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south@@ -@@ east coast caused several casu@@ alti@@ es@@ .
There is apparently a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin@@ .
"@@ The bomb attacks bear the same sign@@ at@@ ure@@ ,@@ " said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee to journalists early on Friday mor@@ ning@@ .
"@@ We are assuming that the attacks were coordin@@ at@@ ed@@ "@@ .
It is too early to specul@@ ate on possible motiv@@ es@@ , he says - ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , it is probably the actions of Muslim re@@ bel@@ s.
The Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the Thai police issued a statement that the attacks were not connected with the Islamist resistance movement or with global terror@@ ism@@ .
"@@ It is just local sab@@ ot@@ age@@ , limited to particular areas and prov@@ inc@@ es@@ ,@@ " said a spokesperson in Bang@@ ko@@ k.
It is more reasonable to assume that the bombs were set off by opponents of the military junta currently ruling the country@@ .
Over the past few da@@ ys@@ , the authorities have received notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for@@ .
It is still apparently unclear who is behind the attack@@ s.
The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security around important governmental buil@@ ding@@ s@@ , along with air@@ por@@ ts@@ , railway st@@ ations@@ , tourist attrac@@ tions@@ , restaurants and nightlife di@@ stric@@ ts@@ .
Small@@ -@@ scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thail@@ and@@ , but they are rarely directed at tourist@@ s.
There is a palace in Hua Hin that was used by Thail@@ and@@ '@@ s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j for year@@ s.
After the recent bomb explosions@@ , the Austrian Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation on its homepage that Austrians follow the instructions from the Thai security agencies at all tim@@ es@@ .
The provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ wat@@ , Y@@ al@@ a@@ , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kla@@ , along with Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and its surro@@ und@@ ings@@ , have been issued with a high security alert (@@ security level 3@@ )@@ .
After skir@@ mis@@ hes between security forces and Muslim sectors of the popul@@ ation@@ , people are advised against all but essential travel to these di@@ stric@@ ts@@ .
The rest of the country is on an increased security alert (@@ security level 2@@ )@@ .
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military jun@@ ta@@ .
This will give the military lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale influence even in the years to com@@ e.
The Head of the jun@@ ta@@ , and Prime Minister@@ , Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan@@ -@@ o@@ -@@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos when the country was heading towards stabili@@ ty@@ , an improved economic climate and tour@@ ism@@ .
The military junta took power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest@@ , and believes that it has led the kingdom back to stability and order@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the military has not managed to qu@@ ell the latent resistance brewing with Muslim rebels in the southern edges of the country@@ .
More than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict so far@@ .
A little under a year ago@@ , 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Ban@@ kok - the majority of whom were foreign tourist@@ s.
It was the most bloody attack in the country@@ '@@ s recent histor@@ y@@ .




The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has the right@@ -@@ wing "@@ Identi@@ täre Bewe@@ gung@@ " movement in its sigh@@ ts@@ .
After several regional authorities had done so@@ , the body charged with protecting the constitution across Germany has also put the group on a watch@@ list@@ .
"@@ In terms of the "@@ Identi@@ täre Bewe@@ gung@@ " mo@@ ve@@ ment@@ , we can see clear indicators of efforts against the free@@ , democratic order@@ ,@@ " said Hans@@ -@@ Georg Ma@@ a@@ ßen@@ , head of constitutional protection@@ , to the German press agency in Berlin@@ .
Muslim migrants or migrants from the Middle East were vi@@ lified in an extremist man@@ ner@@ .
That is why we will also be monitoring the movement from hence@@ forth@@ .
The "@@ Identi@@ täre Bewe@@ gung@@ " is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 201@@ 2.
It fights against "@@ multicultural ma@@ d@@ ness@@ "@@ , "@@ uncontrolled mass im@@ migr@@ ation@@ " and "@@ the loss of national identity through foreign@@ ers@@ "@@ .
Bo@@ dies protecting the constitution across nine federal states - Bre@@ men@@ , Bav@@ ari@@ an@@ , Hes@@ se@@ , Berlin@@ , Ba@@ den@@ -@@ Wür@@ ttember@@ g@@ , North Rhin@@ e@@ -@@ Westpha@@ lia@@ , Lower Sax@@ ony@@ , Saxony and Thuringia - already have the "@@ Identi@@ tä@@ re@@ " under observ@@ ation@@ .
Ma@@ a@@ ßen said that his authority had worked closely with regional authorities to come to its deci@@ sion@@ .
"@@ Groups such as the "@@ Identi@@ täre Bewe@@ gung@@ " are trying to approach their target group on their level@@ ,@@ " said the head of constitutional protection@@ .
In gener@@ al@@ , extremists attempt to speak to them in young pe@@ op@@ le@@ '@@ s own langu@@ age@@ , often with pop musi@@ c.
Radical Islamists and right@@ -@@ wing extremists both do th@@ is@@ .
It@@ '@@ s not calm advertisement for the actual matter at hand@@ .
This propaganda is designed to provoke an emotional response in pe@@ op@@ le@@ .
Young people are particularly vulnerable to th@@ is@@ .
This is danger@@ ous@@ .
Rec@@ ent@@ ly@@ , there have been reports from several federal states pointing out contact between members of the "@@ Identi@@ tä@@ re@@ " movement and Af@@ D politi@@ ci@@ ans@@ .
Ma@@ a@@ ßen said he had no information on th@@ is@@ .
In terms of constitutional protection@@ , potential contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain poin@@ t@@ , he sa@@ ys@@ .
It depends on whether the party in question - in this cas@@ e@@ , the Af@@ D - changes its focus and becomes extremist as a result of particular people who are extremi@@ st@@ s.
There@@ fore@@ , the decisive factor is whether these people exert a controlling influence over the part@@ y@@ .
This has not been not@@ ed@@ .
With regard to the clear increase in right@@ -@@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters@@ , Ma@@ a@@ ßen said that he would not yet speak of a new right@@ -@@ wing terror@@ ism@@ .
But@@ , over the past few year@@ s@@ , we have determined that right@@ -@@ wing terrorist structures can exist@@ .
There was the "@@ Old School Soci@@ et@@ y@@ " group or the "@@ Freit@@ aler Group@@ "@@ .
It can absolutely be the case that additional right@@ -@@ wing terrorist groups or small gatherings come to exist@@ , and plan attacks on asylum seek@@ ers@@ , refugee shel@@ ters@@ , or for other far@@ -@@ right motiv@@ es@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , there is no German@@ y@@ -@@ wide or Europe@@ -@@ wide control of far@@ -@@ right terrorism that we can discern@@ .
The groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social net@@ work@@ s.
Ma@@ a@@ ßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had previously not been involved in the far@@ -@@ right scen@@ e.
That is frigh@@ ten@@ ing@@ .
Many of those suspected of carrying out the attacks on asylum centers were not viewed as crimin@@ als@@ , politically motivated perpetrators or members of the far@@ -@@ right scen@@ e.
"@@ This means that many people have committed crimes who previously paid the far@@ -@@ right no he@@ ed@@ , who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CD@@ U@@ , SPD or the Le@@ ft@@ , who were then radic@@ alised by far@@ -@@ right sensation@@ ali@@ sm@@ "@@ .




Rio 201@@ 6@@ : Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Internet sensation

This is shown by Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te@@ '@@ s brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ ei@@ ro@@ .

He just disappeared - no matter how wide a perspective was us@@ ed@@ .
Hab@@ te finally become a viral internet sensation on social net@@ work@@ s.
The 24@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old completed his heat 48 seconds slower than the nex@@ t@@ -@@ fastest competi@@ tor@@ , taking place 59 out of 5@@ 9.
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , it was his not@@ -@@ quite sporty figure that caught the eye of the international medi@@ a.
Why was the 24@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old taking part in the Olympic gam@@ es@@ ?
The Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming feder@@ ation@@ .
This is given out to popul@@ arise swimming in under@@ represented coun@@ tri@@ es@@ .
Bec@@ ause most athletes from Ethiopia run@@ , Hab@@ te wanted to do something differ@@ ent@@ .

The first nick@@ names were soon doing the round@@ s.
Some media outlets dubbed him "@@ Ro@@ bel the wh@@ ale@@ "@@ .
With reference to his "@@ f@@ lab@@ by stom@@ ach@@ "@@ , the British tab@@ lo@@ id "@@ The Sun@@ " mo@@ cked his "@@ D@@ ad Bod@@ "@@ .
His time@@ , almost one minute and five seconds for the 100 metre fre@@ est@@ yle@@ , played no part in th@@ is@@ .
Compar@@ isons were also made with "@@ Eric the E@@ el@@ "@@ .
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sy@@ d@@ ne@@ y@@ , Eric Mous@@ sam@@ bani@@ '@@ s race also drew media atten@@ tion@@ .
The performance of the swi@@ mmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforge@@ tt@@ able@@ : he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own@@ .

GfK managing director steps down after disappointing figures
Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hart@@ mann@@ .
His resignation came swiftly - but it was not a complete sur@@ pris@@ e.

From 1 October 201@@ 6@@ , fees per cubic metre of sewage for the area covered by the sewage plant at Neu@@ dor@@ f@@ /@@ Reu@@ th@@ /@@ Wel@@ schen@@ k@@ ahl will be 3.@@ 44 euros instead of 2.@@ 10 euros as previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ , 3.@@ 36 euros (@@ previously 2.@@ 26 euro@@ s@@ ) for Zul@@ ten@@ berg@@ /@@ Linden@@ berg@@ /@@ L@@ opp@@ , and 3.@@ 64 euros (@@ previously 2.@@ 18 euro@@ s@@ ) for Az@@ endor@@ f.
The sewage fee for the sewage works in Az@@ endorf will be raised again if it is necessary to carry out improvement work@@ s.
According to an estimated calcul@@ ation@@ , sewage fees in Az@@ endorf will then come to 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic met@@ re@@ .
As mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser (@@ CS@@ U@@ ) re@@ porte@@ d@@ , when the district administration of Kul@@ mb@@ ach approved the budget@@ , it was determined that these sewage plants were under@@ fun@@ de@@ d.
The market town of Kas@@ endorf is legally obliged to run the sewage works so that they break even@@ .
From 1 October 201@@ 6@@ , individuals and commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ schen@@ k@@ ahl@@ , Neu@@ dor@@ f@@ , Reu@@ th@@ , Az@@ endor@@ f@@ , L@@ opp@@ , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to dig a little de@@ e@@ per@@ .
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent@@ .
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the commit@@ te@@ e@@ , it was necessary to rec@@ alcul@@ ate the fees for the sewage plants serving the market town@@ .
Between October 2016 and September 20@@ 20@@ , over@@ funding and under@@ funding from the previous calculation period will be balanced out@@ .
Schmidt justifies the major fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small and deal with a very small amount of waste@@ , namely between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres a pear@@ .
As a result of the low distribu@@ tion@@ , expenses for critical repairs amounting to several thousand euro@@ s@@ , for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , seem maj@@ or@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decre@@ as@@ ing@@ .
Fur@@ ther@@ more@@ , the previous calculation period did not include renovation and repair works to a great extent for all three treatment plan@@ ts@@ , not least because of their age@@ .
The plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old@@ , the plants in Wel@@ schen@@ k@@ ahl@@ , Neu@@ dorf and Reu@@ th@@ , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg@@ , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years ol@@ d.
Schmidt pointed out that the waste treatment plant at Az@@ endorf needed to have its mechanical ventilation system replaced because of dam@@ age@@ .
The conveyor system in the pumping station at Wel@@ schen@@ k@@ ahl is almost 20 years old@@ , and needs to be completely overhau@@ le@@ d@@ ; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lop@@ p has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dre@@ d@@ ge@@ d@@ , its sewage sludge remo@@ ved@@ , and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the fut@@ ure@@ .
Schmid@@ t@@ : "@@ These extraordinary expenses were also coupled with perpetual support and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation peri@@ od@@ .@@ "
The same is true for electricity cost@@ s@@ : in the previous calculations for 201@@ 1@@ /@@ 201@@ 2@@ , they are far below their current level@@ s.
Stein@@ häuser pointed out th@@ at@@ , even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plan@@ ts@@ , the expenses for running and maintaining them "@@ were significantly imp@@ ac@@ ted@@ "@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , Schmidt expan@@ de@@ d@@ , the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 year@@ s.
From Stein@@ hä@@ user@@ '@@ s per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ve@@ , the plants mentioned will remain in a precarious situation in the long run@@ , especially as the area covered by Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are running at a defic@@ it@@ .

Snap@@ chat "@@ Ani@@ me@@ " Effect Is Cri@@ tici@@ zed as Asian Car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says this filter is inspired by anim@@ e@@ , but some observers say it@@ '@@ s ra@@ cially in@@ sensi@@ ti@@ ve@@ .
With its lens tool@@ , Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absur@@ d.
You can turn yourself into a pine@@ apple@@ , a dog or a character be@@ fitting a Roy Licht@@ enstein pain@@ ting@@ .
The lenses are bl@@ unt@@ , feat@@ ure@@ -@@ war@@ ping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies a day@@ .
Any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record@@ .
Snap@@ chat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting black@@ face or encouraging whit@@ ened skin tones as an ideal of beau@@ ty@@ .
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them s@@ lan@@ ted ey@@ es@@ , distorted teeth and pu@@ ffy che@@ ek@@ s@@ , some critics called it a racist caric@@ ature of Asian people - "@@ yel@@ low@@ fac@@ e.@@ "
And they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversi@@ ty@@ .
The news and the outrage went wide on Wedn@@ es@@ day@@ , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board@@ , a day after Snap@@ chat said it had dismantled the feat@@ ure@@ .
The company offered an explan@@ ation@@ : The lens was meant as homage to anim@@ e character@@ s@@ , not as a caric@@ ature of Asian pe@@ op@@ le@@ .
But for observers who have experienced rac@@ ism@@ , the lens reminded them of hur@@ tful stereotypes in ac@@ tion@@ .
Others round@@ ly rejected the anim@@ e compar@@ ison@@ .
In an em@@ ail@@ , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani@@ , a Korean American art student whose twe@@ et about the photos was widely sha@@ red@@ , said that the lens was "@@ hur@@ tful and uncomfortable to say the le@@ ast@@ .@@ "
She added that "@@ it@@ '@@ s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caric@@ ature and the filter@@ '@@ s effec@@ ts@@ .
It shows that the filter is@@ n@@ '@@ t just yel@@ low@@ fac@@ e@@ , but yel@@ low@@ face taken to its dero@@ g@@ atory extre@@ me@@ .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company to cross these cultural trip@@ wi@@ res@@ .
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclu@@ sion@@ , from corporate board@@ rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hand@@ s.
And Snap@@ chat@@ '@@ s huge audience of younger people - who are more ra@@ cially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensi@@ tiv@@ ity@@ .
When one of Snap@@ chat@@ '@@ s lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user@@ , 25@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thurs@@ day@@ , "@@ it@@ '@@ s much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before@@ .@@ "
On Thurs@@ day@@ , Ms. Z@@ hu@@ , a product manager and engineer who works for Medi@@ um@@ , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and encouraged others to do the sam@@ e.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone inter@@ view@@ , she said she believed that the ra@@ ce@@ -@@ related controversi@@ es reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snap@@ chat@@ .
Ms. Z@@ hu criticized the comp@@ any@@ '@@ s mostly whit@@ e@@ , all@@ -@@ male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag@@ : #@@ Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat@@ .
"@@ It@@ '@@ s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where the@@ y@@ '@@ re able to make decisions like th@@ is@@ ,@@ " Ms. Z@@ hu@@ , who is Chin@@ ese@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can@@ , sa@@ id@@ , "@@ or they do have some people of color who are working there@@ , but the@@ y@@ '@@ re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up@@ .@@ "
Other observers share her view@@ , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has left largely un@@ answer@@ ed@@ .
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff@@ , noting its status as a private comp@@ any@@ .
On Thurs@@ day@@ , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff@@ , but according to a spokes@@ man@@ , the company recently hired a recru@@ iter to focus on under@@ represented populations and on driving inclusion efforts intern@@ all@@ y@@ .
For her part@@ , Ms. Z@@ hu said she would keep her Snap@@ chat account clo@@ sed@@ , ad@@ ding@@ , "@@ I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.@@ K.@@ "




Military Off@@ ici@@ als Di@@ stor@@ ted ISIS Intelli@@ gen@@ ce@@ , Con@@ gressional Panel Sa@@ ys
Off@@ ici@@ als from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warran@@ ted@@ , a con@@ gressional panel said in a report issued Thurs@@ day@@ .
The interim re@@ port@@ , from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Commit@@ te@@ e@@ , Intelligence Committee and Defense Ap@@ propri@@ ations Sub@@ commit@@ te@@ e@@ , found "@@ widespread dis@@ satisfac@@ tion@@ " among Central Command intelligence an@@ alyst@@ s@@ , who said superi@@ ors were doc@@ toring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State@@ .
Central Comm@@ and@@ , known as Cent@@ com@@ , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a@@ , Fla@@ .@@ , that over@@ sees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asi@@ a.
"@@ Intelligence products approved by senior Cent@@ com leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. anti@@ terrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence commun@@ ity@@ ,@@ " a news release about the report sa@@ i@@ d.
"@@ What happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy ma@@ ker@@ s@@ ,@@ " said Representative Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t@@ , Republican of Califor@@ ni@@ a.
The leadership failures at Cent@@ com reach to the very top of the organiz@@ ation@@ .
The 10@@ -@@ page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Comm@@ and@@ '@@ s description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi for@@ ces@@ .
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doc@@ to@@ red@@ , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Cent@@ com leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State@@ , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL@@ .
"@@ Th@@ rough@@ out the first half of 201@@ 5@@ , many Central Command press rele@@ as@@ es@@ , statements and con@@ gressional testimon@@ ies were significantly more positive than actual event@@ s@@ ,@@ " the report sa@@ i@@ d.
For ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , a Cent@@ com official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mo@@ sul could begin as early as April or May 201@@ 5.
Mo@@ sul@@ , Iraq@@ '@@ s secon@@ d@@ -@@ largest city@@ , remains under the control of the Islamic State@@ .
"@@ After months of investig@@ ation@@ , this much is very cle@@ ar@@ ,@@ " Representative Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o@@ , Republican of Kans@@ as@@ , said in a state@@ ment@@ .
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 201@@ 5@@ , the United States Central Comm@@ and@@ '@@ s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command@@ '@@ s intelligence products to down@@ play the threat from ISIS in Iraq@@ .
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipul@@ at@@ ed@@ .
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continu@@ es@@ .
There is an addi@@ tion@@ al@@ , ongoing investigation of Cent@@ com intelligence by the Department of Defense inspec@@ tor gener@@ al@@ .
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task for@@ ce@@ .
"@@ Between 2014 and 201@@ 5@@ , Cent@@ com created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi Security For@@ ces@@ ,@@ " Representative Adam B. Schiff@@ , the commit@@ te@@ e@@ '@@ s top Democ@@ rat@@ , said in a state@@ ment@@ .
This process@@ , Mr. Schiff sa@@ id@@ , "@@ stalled the release of intelligence produc@@ ts@@ ,@@ " hurt mor@@ ale among analysts and "@@ insufficiently accommodated dis@@ sent@@ ing view@@ s.@@ "
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Cent@@ com analysts to fit their conclusions to a "@@ preset or political narrati@@ ve@@ .@@ "
The preliminary results of the con@@ gressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast@@ .
Last August@@ , The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspec@@ tor general investig@@ ation@@ , opened after complaints by Cent@@ com an@@ alyst@@ s.
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans@@ , a Pentagon spokes@@ man@@ , said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the con@@ gressional report while the inspec@@ tor gener@@ al@@ '@@ s investigation continu@@ ed@@ .
But he said that "@@ experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex dat@@ a@@ , and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topic@@ s.@@ "
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the Ameri@@ can@@ -@@ led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (@@ an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense offici@@ als@@ )@@ .
But last year@@ '@@ s allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq@@ , Afghani@@ stan@@ , Libya and other crisis spo@@ ts@@ .
The cri@@ tiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago@@ , when a Cent@@ com intelligence an@@ alyst@@ , Gregory Hoo@@ ker@@ , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bus@@ h@@ , over many an@@ alyst@@ s@@ " objec@@ tions@@ , advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 inv@@ a@@ sion@@ .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key part in the insur@@ rection over the Islamic State intelligen@@ ce@@ .
Last year@@ , officials sa@@ id@@ , Mr. Hoo@@ ker@@ '@@ s team concluded that despite public statements to the contr@@ ary@@ , air@@ strikes against Islamic State@@ -@@ held refin@@ eries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group@@ '@@ s finances because it had built ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft refin@@ eries to sell oil on the black market@@ .
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Comm@@ and@@ , The Times reported in Sept@@ ember@@ .
Cent@@ com@@ '@@ s commander th@@ en@@ , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III@@ , came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many law@@ makers as being an overly positive assessment of the war@@ .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. Vot@@ el@@ .




U.S. W@@ ins 4th Straight in W@@ omen@@ '@@ s Field Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ , Set@@ ting Up Show@@ down With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6@@ -1 victory over Jap@@ an@@ , K@@ atie B@@ am scored the first two goals for the United States wom@@ en@@ '@@ s field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated Indi@@ a@@ , 3@@ -@@ 0@@ .
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat@@ , but Bam@@ , 27@@ , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same th@@ ing@@ .
"@@ I have no clu@@ e@@ ,@@ " she sa@@ i@@ d.
I@@ '@@ m not really one of those people who keeps track of their go@@ al@@ s.
Here is what she does know@@ : The Americans are 4@@ -@@ 0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Brit@@ ain@@ , which remained unbe@@ aten after defeating Jap@@ an@@ , 2@@ -@@ 0@@ , on Thurs@@ day@@ .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round@@ .
Bot@@ h teams have qualified for the quarter fin@@ als@@ , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six@@ -@@ team bracket and who finishes secon@@ d.
The fir@@ st@@ -@@ place fin@@ is@@ her will avoid the powerful Dut@@ ch@@ , the leaders of the other bra@@ cket@@ , for a bit longer when the quarter finals beg@@ in@@ .
However Satur@@ day@@ '@@ s game turns out@@ , the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here@@ , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Gam@@ es@@ .
B@@ am was on that team@@ .
She grew up in Blue Bell@@ , Pa@@ .@@ , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (@@ her twin older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ x@@ el@@ ) and joined the national team when she was 16@@ , becoming its youngest player ever@@ .
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final ro@@ ster@@ .
Then came 201@@ 2@@ , when nothing much went right for her and her team@@ mat@@ es@@ .
The next year@@ , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham@@ , an Engli@@ sh@@ man@@ , was named the co@@ ach@@ , and things began to change@@ .
"@@ A cultural change@@ , a mental change@@ , a physical change@@ ,@@ " B@@ am sa@@ i@@ d.
We did@@ n@@ '@@ t have the work rate in London that we have no@@ w.
We@@ '@@ ve made a complete turn@@ aro@@ und@@ .
On Thursday night@@ , B@@ am opened the scoring in the first half with a back@@ hand shot from close in@@ .
India had come into the game without a victory in the tourna@@ ment@@ , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1@@ -@@ 0 until late in the third peri@@ od@@ , when B@@ am took char@@ ge@@ .
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field@@ , then cur@@ led into the middle and whi@@ pped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2@@ -@@ 0 le@@ ad@@ .
Meli@@ ssa Gonzalez added the final goal mid@@ way through the fourth peri@@ od@@ .
The shut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the United States go@@ ali@@ e@@ , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs@@ , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victori@@ es@@ .
She is on a roll@@ .
So is Bam@@ .
"@@ We@@ '@@ re in a good place right now@@ ,@@ " Par@@ n@@ ham sa@@ id@@ , but just how good it is will depend on the result of Satur@@ day@@ '@@ s g@@ ame@@ .




A@@ mid the F@@ ury of the Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ , the Zen of the Tram@@ po@@ line
W@@ her@@ ever you are@@ , whatever time it is@@ , it is the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and in@@ escap@@ able@@ , a fur@@ ious relay of competition and stri@@ v@@ ing@@ .
It is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself were a fl@@ aming bat@@ on@@ , passed from ar@@ cher to swi@@ mmer to gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast to tri@@ athle@@ te@@ .
You can@@ '@@ t turn on a televi@@ sion@@ , read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor@@ '@@ s conversation in a coff@@ ee@@ -@@ shop line without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es@@ , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the feu@@ d between Michael P@@ helps and Chad le C@@ los@@ .
And then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey@@ .
Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey@@ , a fir@@ st@@ -@@ time Olymp@@ ian and a di@@ m@@ pled heart@@ thro@@ b in the ma@@ king@@ , may well be among those household names being show@@ c@@ ased in prime time@@ , buo@@ yed by sponsor@@ ships and fe@@ el@@ -@@ good TV commerci@@ als@@ , if he were a swi@@ mmer@@ , a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast or even a fen@@ cer@@ .
But Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey@@ , 28@@ , of Lake Forest@@ , Cali@@ f.@@ , is competing for the gold in Olympic tram@@ po@@ line@@ .
The Olympic flame does not illum@@ inate each event equ@@ all@@ y@@ .
Further from the center@@ , partly in sha@@ dow@@ , are those sports not universally acknowled@@ ge@@ d@@ : air@@ -@@ pi@@ stol sho@@ ot@@ ing@@ , ar@@ cher@@ y@@ , bad@@ min@@ ton@@ , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do@@ .
We will always have the breast@@ stro@@ ke@@ , and long may it reign@@ .
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favor@@ it@@ e@@ , let me call attention to the discreet charm of the tram@@ po@@ line@@ .
Th@@ ough tram@@ po@@ line has been an Olympic event since 2000@@ , when it deb@@ uted at the Sydney Gam@@ es@@ , it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all@@ .
This may be a regional ignor@@ anc@@ e.
Des@@ p@@ ite sending athletes to compet@@ e@@ , the United States has never won a medal in tram@@ po@@ line and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 201@@ 2.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men@@ , and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the wom@@ en@@ .
Dong Dong of China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year@@ .
But there is an under@@ dog charm to tram@@ po@@ line@@ , in part because it sound@@ s@@ , to the un@@ enlightened ear@@ , fit@@ ter for clo@@ wn college than the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
Here I should confess that I am no exper@@ t@@ , just an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast@@ .
It does have comic potential - the cartoon qua@@ ver of its ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and div@@ ing@@ , the two sports it essentially combin@@ es@@ .
The word "@@ tram@@ po@@ line@@ " derives from the Spanish el tram@@ pol@@ ín@@ , meaning "@@ diving board@@ .@@ "
A@@ spir@@ ing champions jump on a giant tram@@ po@@ line@@ , shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air@@ , and are called upon to perform a series of tu@@ mbling moves (@@ twi@@ st@@ s@@ , pi@@ kes and som@@ er@@ sau@@ l@@ ts@@ ) before eventually landing on their fe@@ et@@ .
They are judged on execu@@ tion@@ , difficulty and "@@ flight time@@ ,@@ " according to the official Olympic program@@ .
Thir@@ ty@@ -@@ two athletes from 17 coun@@ tri@@ es@@ , 16 men and 16 wom@@ en@@ , will compete in Ri@@ o.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ah@@ e@@ ad@@ .
Medal hope@@ ful@@ s must go far@@ ther@@ , fa@@ ster@@ , up and over@@ , in their quest for gold@@ , sometimes to the fin@@ ish@@ , other times back and forth up and down the cour@@ t.
They are ch@@ asing not only the finish line or the starting wall but al@@ so@@ , in the telev@@ ised cover@@ age@@ , another ta@@ unting line@@ : that of the world@@ , or Olymp@@ ic@@ , record@@ .
This sin@@ gle@@ -@@ minded pursuit is no@@ ble@@ , admi@@ ra@@ ble@@ , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to bring even a spect@@ ator to te@@ ar@@ s.
But it is also what I find slightly exhau@@ sting about even watching the Gam@@ es@@ .
From th@@ is@@ , tram@@ po@@ line offers a resp@@ it@@ e.
The tram@@ po@@ lin@@ er@@ '@@ s vector is up@@ .
Forward motion is not the go@@ al@@ .
He or she re@@ bound@@ s@@ , seem@@ ing wei@@ ght@@ less as an astron@@ aut@@ , going up@@ , then down@@ , then effortlessly up aga@@ in@@ .
It is not without competi@@ tion@@ , of cour@@ se@@ , nor without difficul@@ ty@@ , but for the duration of a rout@@ ine@@ , there is no fran@@ tic charge toward the end@@ , no v@@ aul@@ ting into the distan@@ ce@@ , just the dre@@ am@@ y@@ , graceful suspension of time and gravit@@ y@@ .
It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition ge@@ ts@@ .
The wom@@ en@@ '@@ s quali@@ fiers and then finals will take place on Friday afterno@@ on@@ , streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time@@ ; the men@@ '@@ s on Satur@@ day@@ , also at 1.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both da@@ ys@@ .
In the midst of Olympic mani@@ a@@ , they promise a quiet@@ , lovely moment@@ , one likely to be overlooked in the general m@@ ele@@ e.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for og@@ ling and objec@@ tification - as the United States men@@ '@@ s gy@@ mna@@ sts recently propos@@ ed@@ , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey only awaits his gas@@ ping new fan bas@@ e.




"@@ A Generation Is Protest@@ ing@@ " in Ethiop@@ ia@@ , Long a U.S. Al@@ ly
Viol@@ ent Pro@@ tests in Ethiopia
Demonstr@@ ators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the govern@@ ment@@ .
Wit@@ nesses say that scores of protesters have been fat@@ ally shot during clashes with poli@@ ce@@ .
Is Ethiopia about to crack@@ ?
For the last dec@@ ade@@ , it has been one Afri@@ ca@@ '@@ s most stable nation@@ s@@ , a solid Western ally with a fast@@ -@@ growing econom@@ y@@ .
But in recent mon@@ th@@ s@@ , anti@@ -@@ government protests have conv@@ ul@@ sed the country@@ , spreading into more and more are@@ as@@ .
In the last week al@@ one@@ , thousands of people stor@@ med into the street@@ s@@ , demanding fundamental political change@@ .
The government respon@@ se@@ , according to human rights group@@ s@@ , was ruth@@ less@@ .
Wit@@ nesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ator@@ s.
Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whi@@ pping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform hand@@ stands against a wall@@ .
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investig@@ ation@@ .
"@@ It was always difficult holding this country toge@@ ther@@ , and moving forwar@@ d@@ , it will be even har@@ der@@ ,@@ " said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di@@ , the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group@@ , a research group@@ .
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Afri@@ ca@@ , after Nigeri@@ a@@ , and its stability is cherished by the West@@ .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region@@ , especially in Som@@ ali@@ a@@ , and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western ai@@ d.
Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s economy has been expanding at an impressive cli@@ p.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new comm@@ uter train in the cap@@ ital@@ , Addis Ab@@ ab@@ a.
And its streets are typically quiet@@ , safe and clean@@ .
Th@@ ough Ethiopia has hardly been a parag@@ on of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the govern@@ ment@@ '@@ s repres@@ siveness - opposition within the country had been limit@@ ed@@ , with dissidents effectively silen@@ c@@ ed@@ .
Many have been exi@@ le@@ d@@ , j@@ ai@@ le@@ d@@ , killed or driven to the far reaches of the deser@@ t.
But that may be chan@@ g@@ ing@@ .
"@@ If you suff@@ oc@@ ate people and they don@@ '@@ t have any other options but to prote@@ st@@ , it breaks out@@ ,@@ " said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home@@ , a university lecturer in central Ethiop@@ i@@ a.
The whole youth is prote@@ st@@ ing@@ .
A generation is prote@@ st@@ ing@@ .
The complaints are man@@ y@@ , covering everything from land use to the governing co@@ ali@@ tion@@ '@@ s stran@@ gle@@ hold on power@@ .
After a widely criticized election last year@@ , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parlia@@ ment@@ .
At the same time@@ , tensions are rising along the border with Erit@@ re@@ a@@ ; a battle along that jag@@ ge@@ d@@ , disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in Jun@@ e.
An@@ alysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less van@@ qu@@ ished in recent year@@ s@@ , like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front@@ , may try to exploit the turbulence and re@@ ar@@ m.
Sever@@ al factors explain why bitter fe@@ el@@ ings@@ , after years of si@@ mm@@ ering beneath the sur@@ fac@@ e@@ , are explo@@ ding no@@ w.
The first is seemingly inno@@ cu@@ ous@@ : smart@@ ph@@ ones@@ .
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiop@@ ians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smart@@ phones became common and internet service impro@@ ved@@ .
Even when the government sh@@ uts down access to Facebook and Twi@@ tter@@ , as it frequently do@@ es@@ , especially during prote@@ st@@ s@@ , many people are still able to communicate via internet pro@@ xies that mask where they are@@ .
Sever@@ al young Ethiop@@ ians said this was how they gathered for prote@@ st@@ s.
Secon@@ d@@ , there is more solidarity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as@@ , Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s two largest ethnic group@@ s.
Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural alli@@ es@@ .
For e@@ ons@@ , Am@@ har@@ as from Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s predominantly Christian highlands flour@@ ished in politics and business@@ , exploiting the Oro@@ mos@@ , many of whom are Muslim and live in low@@ land are@@ as@@ .
But that is changing as well@@ .
"@@ We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrel@@ la@@ ,@@ " said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u@@ , an Oro@@ mo lea@@ der@@ .
The biggest protests have been in Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mo are@@ as@@ .
Many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Ti@@ gra@@ yan ethnic group@@ , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the militar@@ y@@ , the intelligence servi@@ ces@@ , commerce and politic@@ s.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Mel@@ es Zen@@ a@@ wi@@ .
Mr. Mel@@ es@@ , a former rebel lea@@ der@@ , was Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s prime minister for 17 year@@ s@@ , until his death from an un@@ disclosed illness in 201@@ 2.
He was considered a tactical geni@@ us@@ , a man who could see around cor@@ ner@@ s.
An@@ alysts say he was especially ade@@ pt at detecting early signals of discontent and using emis@@ s@@ aries to massage and def@@ ang oppon@@ ent@@ s.
"@@ The current regime lacks that ground sav@@ vy@@ ,@@ " Mr. Ab@@ di@@ , the conflict an@@ alyst@@ , sa@@ i@@ d.
Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s new prime minister@@ , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ ale@@ gn@@ , was plu@@ cked from relative obscur@@ ity to fill Mr. Mel@@ es@@ '@@ s sho@@ es@@ .
Un@@ like Mr. Mel@@ es@@ , who came from the Ti@@ gray region of northern Ethiop@@ ia@@ , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am is a south@@ ern@@ er@@ .
An@@ alysts say he does not have the trust of the Ti@@ gra@@ yan@@ -@@ controlled security servi@@ ces@@ .
The resul@@ t@@ , many fear@@ , is more blood@@ sh@@ ed@@ .
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 200@@ 5@@ , after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government b@@ ung@@ led and then stol@@ e.
In the ensuing crack@@ down@@ , many protesters were kil@@ le@@ d@@ , though fewer than in recent mon@@ th@@ s@@ , and that period of unrest passed relatively quick@@ ly@@ .
Development experts have praised Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s leaders for visionary infrastructure plann@@ ing@@ , such as the new comm@@ uter train@@ , and measurable strides in fighting pover@@ ty@@ .
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiop@@ ia@@ '@@ s government from intensi@@ fy@@ ing@@ .
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic sha@@ pe@@ .
Last mon@@ th@@ , protesters in Gon@@ dar@@ , an Am@@ har@@ a town@@ , attacked businesses owned by Ti@@ gra@@ y@@ ans@@ , and anti@@ -@@ Ti@@ gra@@ yan hatred is becoming more common in social medi@@ a.
An@@ alysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position@@ .
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for dr@@ one flights over neighboring Som@@ ali@@ a@@ , though it recently said it closed that bas@@ e.
While the West clearly wants to support democ@@ ra@@ cy@@ , it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to cru@@ m@@ ble@@ .
"@@ That@@ ,@@ " Mr. Ab@@ di sa@@ id@@ , "@@ is a very tight rope to wal@@ k.@@ "




Donald Trump Ex@@ plains His Ob@@ ama@@ -@@ Fo@@ unde@@ d@@ -@@ ISIS Cla@@ im as "@@ Sar@@ cas@@ m@@ "
Donald J. Trump tried to qu@@ ash the latest controversy eng@@ ul@@ fing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "@@ fo@@ under@@ s@@ " of the Islamic State terrorist group@@ .
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nomine@@ e@@ '@@ s ability to communicate clearly to the American public@@ .
It also put his surro@@ gat@@ es@@ , who have strained to defend him during a tu@@ mul@@ tuous stret@@ ch@@ , in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean@@ .
After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night@@ , Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thurs@@ day@@ , insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS@@ .
But in an ear@@ ly@@ -@@ morning Twitter post on Fri@@ day@@ , Mr. Trump said that he was just being sar@@ cas@@ tic@@ .
The post was a reversal from just a day ago@@ , when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the char@@ ge@@ .
When the conservative radio host Hugh He@@ witt tried to help Mr. Trump so@@ ften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS@@ , the Republican presidential nominee would not have it@@ .
The latest fire@@ storm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to re@@ focus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll number@@ s.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave du@@ eling economic speeches in Michigan this week@@ .
On Fri@@ day@@ , Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subjec@@ t.
Tak@@ ing again to Twi@@ tter@@ , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech bor@@ ing@@ .
Mr. Trump has used the sar@@ cas@@ m defense before@@ .
In late J@@ ul@@ y@@ , after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s em@@ ail@@ s@@ , he later explained his remarks by say@@ ing@@ , "@@ Of course I@@ '@@ m being sar@@ cas@@ tic@@ .@@ "
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as ne@@ ede@@ d.
"@@ I think it@@ '@@ s a pattern of him testing certain messages that reson@@ ate with his fan@@ s@@ , seeing how they play@@ , and then "@@ clari@@ fy@@ ing@@ " one way or another depending on the reac@@ tion@@ ,@@ " said Ruth Sher@@ man@@ , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candi@@ dat@@ es@@ .
But I also think he@@ '@@ s clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various l@@ ens@@ es@@ .
In@@ stead of ton@@ ing things down for a general election au@@ dien@@ ce@@ , Mr. Trump has taken an even more caus@@ tic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tum@@ ble@@ .
A new NB@@ C@@ /@@ Wall Street Journ@@ al@@ /@@ Mar@@ ist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump tra@@ iling Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Car@@ ol@@ in@@ a@@ , Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Flori@@ da@@ .
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologi@@ zing for provocative things that he sa@@ ys@@ , he often acc@@ uses his critics of mis@@ constru@@ ing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor@@ .
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign@@ , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remark@@ s.
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani@@ , the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s most prominent surro@@ gat@@ es@@ , went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thurs@@ day@@ .
"@@ I think what he@@ '@@ s saying there is legitim@@ ate@@ , political com@@ mentar@@ y@@ ,@@ " Mr. Giuli@@ ani said when questioned about the ver@@ acity of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State@@ .
It is true in a sense that before Ob@@ ama@@ , ISIS was an almost un@@ kno@@ wn@@ , small little organiz@@ ation@@ , he who called it the j@@ ay@@ ve@@ e@@ , totally wrong@@ , and here@@ '@@ s why it happ@@ en@@ ed@@ , because he withdrew the troops from Iraq@@ .
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administr@@ ation@@ , in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state@@ , allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East@@ .
A@@ head of r@@ allies in Pennsylvania on Fri@@ day@@ , Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for har@@ ping on his every word and for being biased against hi@@ m.
He mo@@ cked the "@@ poor@@ , pa@@ the@@ tic@@ " television pun@@ dits who try to figure him out and sa@@ id@@ , "@@ They can@@ '@@ t@@ !@@ "
Some Democrats s@@ coff@@ ed at Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s excuse as more evidence that he is un@@ fit to be pre@@ sident@@ .




Once Pri@@ ced Out@@ , a Cafe Ret@@ urns in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a shab@@ by@@ , cas@@ h@@ -@@ only space in Willi@@ am@@ sburg that had no Wi@@ -@@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 year@@ s.
Natur@@ all@@ y@@ , it got priced out of its Bed@@ ford Avenue sto@@ ref@@ ron@@ t.
The store that replaced the Ver@@ b in the summer of 201@@ 4@@ , So@@ ap Ch@@ erie@@ , sells so@@ aps in the shape of cup@@ c@@ ak@@ es@@ .
Loc@@ als be@@ mo@@ aned it as the latest loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city@@ .
The artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twi@@ tter@@ , "@@ New York is change@@ , I know@@ , but still@@ , can@@ '@@ t believe CB@@ GB@@ '@@ s is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gut@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop@@ .@@ "
But if New York is change@@ , it is also rein@@ vention@@ .
A revived Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ poin@@ t@@ , less than a mile north of the original location@@ .
The new Ver@@ b has Wi@@ -@@ Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar un@@ preten@@ tious vi@@ be@@ .
The coffee is still good@@ , to@@ o.
Leading the new Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez@@ , a long@@ time employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new plac@@ e.
He started at Ver@@ b in 2001 and was there until the end@@ .
When a customer offered to bankro@@ ll him in a new out@@ post@@ , he said he was excited to do it@@ .
Mr. Rodri@@ gu@@ ez@@ , 36@@ , kept a lot of things the sam@@ e.
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els and bought the same model of espresso mach@@ ine@@ .
It even reused the lights from the old Verb@@ .
But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment@@ .
He introduced new ingredi@@ ent@@ s.
Bac@@ on@@ -@@ e@@ gg@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ cheese sandwiches are on the menu@@ , and t@@ opp@@ ings like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed oni@@ ons are avail@@ able@@ .
There are bro@@ wn@@ -@@ rice bow@@ l@@ s.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh ju@@ ic@@ es@@ .
Nine months in@@ , Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regul@@ ar@@ s.
"@@ A lot of former customers got priced out of Willi@@ am@@ sburg to@@ o@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
On a recent Sun@@ day@@ , Rebe@@ cca Oliv@@ eira was one such custom@@ er@@ .
Ms. Oli@@ vei@@ ra@@ , 34@@ , used to live in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and went to Ver@@ b frequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ .
Even after she moved to Green@@ poin@@ t@@ , she would still make the tre@@ k.
After Ver@@ b clo@@ sed@@ , she sa@@ id@@ , she gave up drinking coffee for a whi@@ le@@ .
"@@ I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Ver@@ b that I lik@@ ed@@ ,@@ " she sa@@ i@@ d.
Now she@@ '@@ s back on coff@@ ee@@ , although that day@@ , instead of her usual iced coff@@ ee@@ , she went with a blended ch@@ ai drin@@ k@@ , another new addi@@ tion@@ .
Tom Rosen@@ thal@@ , another long@@ time custom@@ er@@ , went faithfully to Ver@@ b starting in 200@@ 3.
He@@ '@@ d go before work and order the same thing without fail@@ .
"@@ Quarter past seven@@ , every day@@ , like clock@@ work@@ , I@@ '@@ d come in and they were making my everything ba@@ gel with butter@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the men@@ u.
These da@@ ys@@ , Mr. Rosen@@ thal still gets his regular order@@ , but sometimes he@@ '@@ ll switch things up with the bac@@ on@@ , egg and cheese on an everything bag@@ el@@ .
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old spac@@ e.
In fac@@ t@@ , the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie owners offered to make special soap for Verb@@ , using the caf@@ e@@ '@@ s col@@ d@@ -@@ bre@@ wed coffee as an ingredi@@ ent@@ .
"@@ I think we still might take them up on it@@ ,@@ " Mr. Rodriguez sa@@ i@@ d.
And Green@@ poin@@ t@@ '@@ s traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well@@ .
One of these new customers translated the menu into Poli@@ sh@@ , and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcom@@ e.
The new location has other per@@ ks@@ .
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the col@@ d@@ -@@ bre@@ wed coff@@ ee@@ .
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent buil@@ ding@@ .
For many custom@@ ers@@ , a new Ver@@ b to get their old favorites is en@@ ou@@ gh@@ .
Joseph Whit@@ t was a regular and said he was heart@@ broken when they clo@@ se@@ d.
When the new space open@@ ed@@ , Mr. Whit@@ t sa@@ id@@ , walking in and getting a coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ om@@ ing@@ .
"@@ I@@ '@@ ve needed to smell th@@ at@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.




The De@@ pressing Food of the De@@ pres@@ sion@@ , in "@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ "
In March 19@@ 33@@ , shortly after asc@@ ending to the presiden@@ cy@@ , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the O@@ val Offic@@ e.
A gour@@ mand@@ , President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like p@@ â@@ té de fo@@ ie gras and Maryland ter@@ rap@@ in sou@@ p.
His menu that day was more hum@@ ble@@ : devi@@ led eggs in tomato sau@@ ce@@ , mas@@ hed potatoes and@@ , for des@@ ser@@ t@@ , pr@@ une pu@@ dd@@ ing@@ .
"@@ It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffer@@ ing@@ ,@@ " Jane Ziegel@@ man sa@@ i@@ d.
Her hus@@ band@@ , Andrew Co@@ e@@ , ad@@ de@@ d@@ , "@@ It was also a message to Americans about how to eat@@ .@@ "
The cou@@ ple@@ , who live in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts@@ , are food histori@@ ans@@ .
Mr. Co@@ e@@ '@@ s last book@@ , "@@ Cho@@ p Su@@ ey@@ ,@@ " was about Chinese cuisine in Ameri@@ ca@@ , while Ms. Ziegel@@ man told the story of life in a Lower East Side ten@@ ement through food in her book "@@ 97 Or@@ char@@ d.@@ "
Thei@@ r new@@ , collaborative work@@ , "@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ ,@@ " which will be published Tuesday by Har@@ per@@ , is a history of American food in the Great De@@ pres@@ sion@@ .

Ms. Ziegel@@ man@@ , 54@@ , ordered a cream cheese and ch@@ opped olive sand@@ wi@@ ch@@ , while Mr. Co@@ e@@ , 57@@ , had the tur@@ key@@ , mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable med@@ ley@@ .

There was pe@@ an@@ ut lo@@ af@@ , liver lo@@ af@@ , bean lo@@ af@@ .
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out@@ .
Ima@@ gine eating enough pe@@ an@@ uts to serve as your d@@ inner@@ .
Mr. Co@@ e gri@@ mac@@ ed@@ .
"@@ It must have sat in your stomach like le@@ ad@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
In the years before the De@@ pres@@ sion@@ , the American table@@ , especially in rural are@@ as@@ , was an all@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat buff@@ et@@ .
Teams of women cooked for male farm@@ work@@ ers@@ , and fresh@@ -@@ baked pie was served at break@@ fast@@ , lunch and d@@ inner@@ .
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ " chronic@@ les the ways the nation cop@@ ed with suddenly not being the land of pl@@ ent@@ y@@ .
"@@ This was a time when food became a cent@@ ral@@ , fraught subject for the American pe@@ op@@ le@@ ,@@ " Mr. Co@@ e sa@@ id@@ , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it@@ .
Equ@@ ally fraught was the new budget di@@ et@@ : Mystery dishes like lo@@ aves and c@@ asser@@ oles became stap@@ les@@ , the c@@ asser@@ ole a "@@ wonderful way to re@@ purpose lefto@@ vers@@ ,@@ " Ms. Ziegel@@ man not@@ ed@@ , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy coating of sau@@ ce@@ .
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit@@ .
Me@@ at@@ , for years the center of the American me@@ al@@ , became a spar@@ ingly appor@@ tioned lux@@ ur@@ y@@ .
St@@ range mas@@ h@@ ups were tried as cal@@ oric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sen@@ se@@ .
In researching the book@@ , which includes recip@@ es@@ , Ms. Ziegel@@ man prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with pe@@ an@@ ut butter@@ .
"@@ It was not a popular addition to the dinner table@@ ,@@ " Mr. Co@@ e sa@@ i@@ d.
Ms. Ziegel@@ man ampli@@ fi@@ ed@@ : "@@ It was sur@@ real@@ .@@ "
Pe@@ an@@ ut butter has nothing to say to a baked oni@@ on@@ .
It was characteristic of a lot of the home@@ -@@ ec recip@@ es@@ .
As never before or sin@@ ce@@ , home economists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley@@ , chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country@@ '@@ s eating habit@@ s.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and ma@@ ga@@ zin@@ es@@ , they encouraged women to become "@@ bud@@ gete@@ ers@@ " and rise to the challenge of transforming glo@@ p like cre@@ amed sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into tasty dish@@ es@@ .
"@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ " is a feast of historical ti@@ d@@ bit@@ s.
E@@ specially sa@@ vory are the accounts of the govern@@ ment@@ '@@ s response to its hungry citiz@@ en@@ ry@@ , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver@@ '@@ s let@@ -@@ me@@ -@@ eat@@ -@@ cake atti@@ tu@@ de@@ .
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his child@@ ho@@ od@@ , he d@@ ined like the million@@ aire sophistic@@ ate he had be@@ com@@ e.
"@@ He liked to eat Continental cuis@@ ine@@ , like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sau@@ ce@@ ,@@ " Mr. Co@@ e sa@@ i@@ d.
He ate in almost a gold@@ -@@ plated dining room@@ , wearing a dinner jack@@ et@@ .
He was fab@@ ul@@ ously out of touch@@ .
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wi@@ fe@@ , Ele@@ an@@ or@@ , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stom@@ ach@@ .
As the book tells it@@ , Mrs. Roosevel@@ t@@ '@@ s hiring of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "@@ put out not only some of the dre@@ ari@@ est food in Washington but also some of the most dis@@ m@@ ally prep@@ are@@ d.@@ "
Many of the De@@ pres@@ sion@@ -@@ era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its fe@@ et@@ .
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutri@@ tion@@ , Ms. Ziegel@@ man sa@@ id@@ , and on the way science has been applied to cook@@ ing@@ .
The couple said that in writing the book@@ , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegel@@ man@@ '@@ s mother - how she cou@@ ld@@ n@@ '@@ t throw food awa@@ y@@ , for in@@ stan@@ ce@@ .
"@@ She had a real fear of food waste@@ ,@@ " Mr. Co@@ e sa@@ i@@ d.
Ms. Ziegel@@ man rec@@ alle@@ d@@ : "@@ She actually got people sick@@ .@@ "
There was the cre@@ am@@ -@@ pu@@ ff inci@@ dent@@ .
After the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg@@ '@@ s@@ , she and Mr. Co@@ e pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home@@ : the pr@@ une dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lun@@ ch.
"@@ It@@ '@@ s called pr@@ une whi@@ p@@ ,@@ " Ms. Ziegel@@ man sa@@ id@@ , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a sn@@ az@@ zy nam@@ e.
There was no whi@@ pped cre@@ am@@ , just prun@@ es@@ , a little bit of flour@@ , su@@ gar@@ , water and c@@ inn@@ amon@@ .
Every@@ one reluc@@ tantly di@@ pped a spo@@ on into the vis@@ cous brown goo@@ .
Sur@@ pris@@ ing@@ ly@@ , it was@@ n@@ '@@ t bad@@ .
Mr. Co@@ e went back for secon@@ ds@@ , and thir@@ d@@ s.
So@@ unding like a can@@ -@@ do budge@@ ter@@ , he told his wi@@ fe@@ , "@@ Some ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would hel@@ p.@@ "




K@@ illed in a bomb attack@@ : He was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
He put his own life at risk to help other@@ s@@ : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar@@ .
He was the hero of Ale@@ p@@ po@@ : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the Syrian pe@@ op@@ le@@ .
He ris@@ ked everything to save other pe@@ op@@ le@@ '@@ s li@@ ves@@ .
Now the 30@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regi@@ me@@ .
Omar was a member of the "@@ White Hel@@ met@@ s@@ "@@ , a civil protection group which@@ , according to Bild newsp@@ aper@@ , had saved the lives of 60,000 pe@@ op@@ le@@ .
2,@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people from bom@@ bed@@ -@@ out houses and perform fir@@ st@@ -@@ aid in the war z@@ one@@ .
They are the heroes of the war in Syri@@ a.
Omar was the face of the group@@ : A video of the civil protection volunteer showing him during an 11@@ -@@ hour operation to rescue an infant from the ruins of a house went viral in 201@@ 4.
It made the Syrian a g@@ lowing figu@@ re@@ head amidst the horror of the war@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , he never saw himself as a hero@@ , say@@ ing@@ , according to Bild@@ : "@@ For me@@ , this is the real ji@@ ha@@ d.@@ "
"@@ If I were to die saving li@@ ves@@ , I would think that God saw me as a marty@@ r.@@ "
Shor@@ tly before Omar himself became a victim of an attack@@ , he had spoken in a video about the recent bomb attacks on Syri@@ a.
Helicop@@ ters had released four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia di@@ stric@@ t@@ , one of which was filled with chlorine gas@@ .
One woman and two children were kil@@ le@@ d@@ , and seven people have been left with breathing difficul@@ ti@@ es@@ .
"@@ We are now clearing away the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don@@ '@@ t play with it@@ ,@@ " quoted Bild as his last words before he di@@ ed@@ .
The fatal bomb dropped by the Assad regime was supposed to have been aimed at terrori@@ st@@ s.




The Greenland sh@@ ark@@ : The oldest verte@@ br@@ ate is almost 400 years old
It@@ '@@ s a rare si@@ ght@@ .
Greenland sharks generally only come to the surface in winter@@ .
After being examined on board the research ship "@@ S@@ ann@@ a@@ "@@ , this shark was returned to the se@@ a.
It was born in 16@@ 24 and has sw@@ um through the North Atlantic at 1@@ k@@ m@@ /@@ h right through to the present day@@ .
Greenland sharks only give birth to young at the age of 150@@ .
Greenland sharks swim leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlan@@ tic@@ , covering an average of 1,@@ 220 metres in an hour@@ .
The fi@@ ve@@ -@@ met@@ re@@ -@@ long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 k@@ m@@ /@@ h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a se@@ al@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , this slow pace of life seems to be the key to a long life@@ .
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues wrote an article in "@@ Sci@@ ence@@ "@@ , the specialist journ@@ al@@ , about a Greenland shark that could be 3@@ 92 years ol@@ d.
"@@ It@@ '@@ s cra@@ zy@@ ,@@ " says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock about this lifes@@ pan - which is a world record for a verte@@ br@@ ate@@ .
It is true that evolutionary biolo@@ gists had long thought that Greenland sharks had been around for a very long time@@ .
They were simply lacking the proo@@ f.
It is hard to observe Greenland sh@@ ark@@ s@@ , namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Can@@ ada@@ , Green@@ land@@ , Norway and S@@ val@@ bar@@ d.
They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Cel@@ si@@ us@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , researchers know little about how Greenland sharks live@@ .
Thei@@ r slow speed was measured by researchers off S@@ val@@ bar@@ d@@ , who fitted six animals with a tra@@ cker@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , these sharks still manage to catch pre@@ y@@ : In one anim@@ al@@ '@@ s stom@@ ach@@ , researchers found the remains of a se@@ al@@ ; another shark had gob@@ bled down the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear@@ .
It may be the case that they hunt down sleeping anim@@ als@@ , or patrol on the ocean floor and look out for cor@@ p@@ ses that have sunk downwards from higher levels of water@@ .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks caught in the depths of the North Atlantic by fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off the coast of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bar@@ d.
The smallest shark was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long@@ , while the largest measured 5@@ 02 cen@@ timet@@ res@@ .
They use carbon@@ -@@ 14 dating on the sh@@ ark@@ '@@ s lens core to determine the sh@@ ark@@ '@@ s age@@ .
This core of the eye@@ '@@ s lens comes into being even before the shark is bor@@ n@@ , and the proteins in it are not renewed subsequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ .
The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon@@ -@@ 14 in their lens co@@ res@@ .
Con@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ , they were likely born after the early 196@@ 0@@ s@@ , when nuclear weapons experiments released large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosp@@ here@@ .
By contra@@ st@@ , the lens cores of thir@@ d@@ -@@ smallest anim@@ al@@ , at 220 cen@@ timet@@ res long@@ , contained less of a surplus of carbon@@ -@@ 14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 201@@ 2@@ , it must have already had its 50th birth@@ day@@ .
By contra@@ st@@ , all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon@@ -@@ 14 in their lens co@@ res@@ , which comes from cosmic radiation in the atmosp@@ here@@ .
In fac@@ t@@ , the carbon@@ -@@ 14 monitor gave a 4@@ 93@@ -@@ cen@@ timet@@ re@@ -@@ long Greenland shark an age of 3@@ 35@@ , while the record@@ -@@ holding sh@@ ark@@ , at 5@@ 02 cen@@ timet@@ res@@ , was apparently 3@@ 92 years ol@@ d.
It was already known that female Greenland sharks first had offspring when they were more than four metres lon@@ g.
Now researchers have been able to map this length onto an age@@ .
As one of the anim@@ als@@ , 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ res long@@ , was likely on the threshold of sexual matur@@ ity@@ , and had an age of 15@@ 6@@ , it seems that Greenland sharks take at least 150 years to be able to re@@ produc@@ e.
This is also a world record for verte@@ br@@ at@@ es@@ .
It is not by chance that such Meth@@ us@@ el@@ ah@@ s predominantly live in icy water@@ s.
The previous record hol@@ der@@ , a 2@@ 11@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old Greenland wh@@ ale@@ , in whose neck a 120@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old har@@ po@@ on tip was lo@@ d@@ ge@@ d@@ , was caught off Alas@@ ka@@ .
As a result of low temper@@ atu@@ res@@ , the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possi@@ ble@@ .
This means they mature later - and age slo@@ wer@@ .
The animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold water@@ s.
This is because their volume increases much quicker than their surface are@@ a@@ , through which the animal radi@@ ates he@@ at@@ .
This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is much bigger than that lost per gram of an eleph@@ ant@@ .
Another advantage is that they have fewer enem@@ i@@ es@@ .
"@@ This means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous life@@ , and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possi@@ ble@@ ,@@ " explains Sch@@ euer@@ l@@ ein@@ , an evolutionary biolo@@ gi@@ st@@ .
By contra@@ st@@ , a very large animal can invest its resources in having a longer life@@ .




Construction sites coming as a tw@@ in@@ pack
The commun@@ e@@ '@@ s council focused on construc@@ tion@@ -@@ related topics in its most recent s@@ ession@@ .
The committee was pleased to hear mayor Robert P@@ utz@@ ' announcement that "@@ we can finally begin to market the residential construction sites that have recently been marked out@@ "@@ .
After plot@@ , parc@@ elling and accessibility questions had been answer@@ ed@@ , and applications for measurements had been ma@@ de@@ , there was nothing standing in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas of "@@ Straß@@ l@@ weg@@ " and "@@ Schön@@ au@@ -@@ West@@ " (@@ near Bin@@ der@@ straße - development section 1@@ ) to interested parti@@ es@@ .
The communal council is convinced that the construction sites in the r@@ ur@@ al@@ , peaceful residential commune of Schön@@ au will attract young families and older people ali@@ ke@@ .
As sa@@ id@@ , people prepared to build on these sites should apply in the town hall from now@@ , and the communal council will probably discuss giving out the plots in its September me@@ et@@ ing@@ .
So that it would be able to answer questions on the movement of additional business@@ es@@ , in connection with the creation of j@@ obs@@ , the communal council decided to amend the space usage plan first re@@ -@@ drawn in spring of this year@@ .
Con@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ , the business area already marked out in Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n will be expanded to include a further two plots near state road 21@@ 12.




Frankfurt will benefit from Brexit
The city on the river Main will soon have the best chance against the competition of Par@@ is@@ , Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London@@ .
"@@ It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vot@@ e@@ ,@@ " said Michael Voi@@ gt@@ länder@@ , Head of I@@ W@@ '@@ s Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist are@@ a.
After the Brexit referendum it is unclear whether financial institutions will still be allowed to run European financial business from London@@ .
Registration in the UK is all that has been required to date for the "@@ EU pas@@ sport@@ "@@ .
This is generally used by large US ban@@ ks@@ .
Sever@@ al banks have already announced that they will relocate job@@ s.
The "@@ Frankfurt Main Finan@@ ce@@ " lobbying group expects to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five year@@ s.
According to the I@@ W@@ , the European Central Bank (@@ EC@@ B@@ )@@ '@@ s head@@ quar@@ ters@@ , responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ z@@ one@@ , all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfur@@ t@@ , along with further important authori@@ ti@@ es@@ , such as EI@@ OP@@ A@@ , Europe@@ '@@ s insurance regulator@@ , and ES@@ R@@ B@@ , the risk board@@ .
While Paris has the headquarters of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (@@ OEC@@ D@@ )@@ , this is less important for the financial sector than the EC@@ B.
"@@ The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can communicate directly with the authori@@ ti@@ es@@ ,@@ " says I@@ W@@ '@@ s Professor Voi@@ gt@@ länder@@ .
While Luxembourg is home to a large funds indu@@ str@@ y@@ , like Dublin@@ , its infrastructure lets it down@@ .
Thanks to its large air@@ port@@ , Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , the city@@ '@@ s easily available business properties are a win@@ .
"@@ In Paris it@@ '@@ s not all that easy to find vacant high@@ -@@ quality offic@@ es@@ ,@@ " said Voi@@ gt@@ länder@@ .
R@@ ents for top@@ -@@ class business properties are 50@@ % higher on the banks of the Seine than on the banks of the Main@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , Frankfurt can offer better quality of life than its competi@@ tor@@ s@@ , thanks to its good medical systems and infra@@ struc@@ ture@@ , and low crime level@@ s.
In a table compiled by management consultants Mer@@ cer@@ , the city was ranked 7@@ th@@ , Luxembourg 19@@ th@@ , Dublin 3@@ 3rd and Paris 37 th@@ .
And even if quality of life is a matter of prefer@@ ence@@ : "@@ Thanks to its already strong position as a financial hub for the European domestic market@@ , Frankfurt could be able to attract additional banks and invest@@ or@@ s@@ ,@@ " I@@ W conclu@@ de@@ d.
Des@@ p@@ ite the Brexit vot@@ e@@ , London will remain Europe@@ '@@ s financial cap@@ ital@@ , according to the economic re@@ sear@@ cher@@ s.
This is also to do with strength rati@@ os@@ : According to figures from regional bank Hel@@ ab@@ a@@ , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 6@@ 2,500 in Frankfur@@ t.

Clin@@ tons earned $@@ 10.@@ 75 million in 201@@ 5@@ , paid 34.@@ 2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax re@@ turn@@ s@@ , which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $@@ 10.@@ 75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 percent@@ .
In 201@@ 5@@ , the Clin@@ tons made $@@ 1 million in charitable contribu@@ tions@@ , mostly to the Clinton Fo@@ und@@ ation@@ ; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $@@ 5.3 million in speaking fe@@ es@@ ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $@@ 3 million from publisher Simon & Schu@@ ster for her book on her tenure at the State De@@ part@@ ment@@ .
Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s running m@@ ate@@ , U.S. Senator Tim Ka@@ ine of Virg@@ ini@@ a@@ , along with his wi@@ fe@@ , Anne Hol@@ ton@@ , released 10 years of tax re@@ turn@@ s.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 percent in 201@@ 5.
"@@ Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set the standard for financial transpar@@ en@@ cy@@ ,@@ " Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri said in a state@@ ment@@ .
In stark contra@@ st@@ , Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and back@@ tracking on his previous promises to release his tax re@@ turn@@ s.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public@@ , although they are not required by law to do so@@ .
Tru@@ mp@@ , a New York business@@ man@@ , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his re@@ turn@@ s.
"@@ Your mo@@ ve@@ ,@@ " Clinton campaign aide Ian Sam@@ s said on Twi@@ tter@@ , linking to the Democratic nomine@@ e@@ '@@ s re@@ turn@@ s.
On Thurs@@ day@@ , Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s special counsel@@ , Michael Coh@@ en@@ , told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are comple@@ te@@ .
Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s critic@@ s@@ , including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mit@@ t Romney and other fellow Republi@@ can@@ s@@ , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth@@ , his charitable contribu@@ tions@@ , his business dealings and various other ti@@ es@@ , including with Russi@@ a.
Clinton has po@@ un@@ ced on the issu@@ e@@ , releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high@@ -@@ profile Republicans urging Trump to release his tax@@ es@@ .
On Thurs@@ day@@ , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michi@@ gan@@ .
"@@ He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax re@@ turn@@ s@@ ,@@ " she told the crow@@ d.
Poli@@ tico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 199@@ 0@@ s@@ , and a New York Times business colum@@ n@@ ist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the cas@@ e.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential elec@@ tion@@ .
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billi@@ on@@ aire investor Warren Buff@@ ett that would ensure those making more than $@@ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent@@ .
President Barack Obama also backs the propos@@ al@@ .
At a Clinton rally last week in Oma@@ ha@@ , Neb@@ ra@@ sk@@ a@@ , Buff@@ ett@@ , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away conglomerate is based there@@ , challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax re@@ turn@@ s.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "@@ af@@ ra@@ id@@ " not of the tax@@ -@@ collection agency but of vo@@ ters@@ .
Clin@@ ton@@ '@@ s campaign has released tax returns going back to 200@@ 7.
The Clin@@ t@@ ons@@ , who now live in C@@ happ@@ aqu@@ a@@ , New Yor@@ k@@ , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 percent@@ .
The Clin@@ t@@ ons@@ ' 2015 return showed th@@ at@@ , unlike most Ameri@@ can@@ s@@ , just $@@ 100 of their income came from wag@@ es@@ .

Jewish film@@ maker sl@@ ams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "@@ request@@ " - RT News
A French film@@ maker of Jewish origin unleashed a media f@@ uro@@ r after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Isra@@ el@@ '@@ s dial code@@ , with employee citing "@@ request@@ s@@ " from Arabic custom@@ er@@ s.
Claude Lanz@@ mann@@ , an author of Holocaust documentary "@@ Sho@@ ah@@ ,@@ " v@@ ented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin@@ , writing an open letter in the German outlet FA@@ Z.
During his recent sta@@ y@@ , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel@@ .
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room@@ .
How is it possi@@ ble@@ , in 2016 in Berlin@@ , the capital of the new German@@ y@@ , that Israel was eliminated and eradic@@ at@@ ed@@ ?
Lanz@@ mann w@@ ro@@ te@@ .
In@@ stead@@ , Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center@@ .
Seek@@ ing explan@@ ation@@ , the film@@ maker addressed the issue at the hotel@@ '@@ s recep@@ tion@@ .
The answer he got there@@ , Lanz@@ mann wrote "@@ shocked him@@ .@@ "
The hotel@@ '@@ s clerk said that the measure was "@@ a deliberate decision by the management of Kemp@@ ins@@ ki@@ -@@ Hot@@ els@@ .@@ "
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the film@@ ma@@ ker@@ .
"@@ The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Isra@@ el@@ '@@ s code to be del@@ et@@ ed@@ ,@@ " the employee was quoted as saying by Lanz@@ mann@@ .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Had@@ as@@ -@@ Handels@@ man called the case a "@@ great shame@@ ,@@ " Su@@ d@@ deutsche Zeitung re@@ por@@ ts@@ .
We were appalled and shocked by the inci@@ dent@@ .
It is in itself a great shame@@ .
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel cha@@ in@@ , is an even greater dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ .
That needs no explan@@ ation@@ .
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclu@@ sions@@ ,@@ " the official sa@@ i@@ d.
The incident triggered quite a response on@@ line@@ , with people calling it a scandal@@ .
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "@@ cav@@ ed in@@ " to the alleged demands of Arabic custom@@ er@@ s.
"@@ Sh@@ ame on you@@ ,@@ " another post stat@@ ed@@ , pointing out that the hotel@@ , located in the noble Kur@@ fur@@ stendamm street stands near a synago@@ gu@@ e.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accus@@ ations@@ , calling what happened an "@@ oversi@@ ght@@ " and "@@ apologi@@ z@@ ing@@ " to Lanz@@ mann@@ , Der Spiegel re@@ por@@ ts@@ .
"@@ There was never a direct order@@ " not to include Israel in the fast dial list@@ ,@@ " Su@@ d@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as say@@ ing@@ .

Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Stu@@ dents clas@@ hed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system@@ .
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the prote@@ ster@@ s.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disper@@ se the stu@@ dent@@ s@@ , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas@@ .
Sever@@ al hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dis@@ may at the plan@@ s.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min@@ , just under 100 public schools will be clo@@ sed@@ , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save mon@@ ey@@ .

This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff as the country@@ '@@ s sen@@ ate voted for her impe@@ ach@@ ment@@ .




Trade between Russia & Iran sur@@ ges 7@@ 1@@ % - RT Business
With the lifting of sanc@@ tions@@ , trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 7@@ 0.9 percent in year@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year ter@@ ms@@ , according to Russi@@ a@@ '@@ s ambassador to Iran@@ , Le@@ van D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan@@ .
Since international sanctions against Iran were li@@ f@@ ted@@ , there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country@@ , the ambassador sa@@ i@@ d.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran@@ , while new firms are ready to get access to the market@@ .
Of cour@@ se@@ , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran@@ ,@@ " D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan sa@@ i@@ d.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $@@ 8@@ 56 million@@ .
In partic@@ ular@@ , Russian exports to Iran jumped by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $@@ 6@@ 97 million@@ .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $@@ 158 million@@ .
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of mach@@ iner@@ y@@ , ground vehicles and weap@@ ons@@ ,@@ " the ambassador sa@@ i@@ d.
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year@@ .
Last year@@ , the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as@@ , mostly travel@@ , to Iranian citiz@@ ens@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russi@@ a.
It@@ '@@ s safe to say that last year@@ '@@ s record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be bro@@ ken@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
At the same time@@ , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran@@ , something the ambassador hopes will change@@ .
"@@ I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an@@ , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.




Wit@@ nesses wan@@ ted@@ : drinks cas@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ carry in Waldbr@@ öl rai@@ ded
A rob@@ bery took place on Thursday evening in the drinks cas@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ carry of Re@@ we XXL on Wal@@ br@@ öl@@ '@@ s Ger@@ ber@@ stra@@ ß@@ e.
Three people dressed in dark clothing and with their faces covered bran@@ di@@ shed a gun and demanded that staff at the cas@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ carry hand over cas@@ h. They made a run for it on foot@@ , and then probably got into a silver VW Golf@@ .
The police did not report how much money had been stol@@ en@@ .
Between 1.6 and 1.7 m tall@@ , the perpetrators were relatively short@@ .
The drinks cas@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ carry can be accessed directly from the Re@@ we super@@ market@@ '@@ s car park@@ , and is tricky to ob@@ ser@@ ve@@ .
After the rob@@ ber@@ y@@ , the perpetrators must have run towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße along Friedrich@@ -@@ Engel@@ ber@@ t@@ -@@ Weg@@ , and then fle@@ d@@ , possibly towards the B 256 (@@ Schla@@ dern ring road@@ ) in the silver car from the Schot@@ ter@@ parkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi@@ -@@ storey car park@@ .
Any@@ one who saw anything around the time of the crime (@@ around 7.@@ 45 p.@@ m.@@ ) that is connected with the rob@@ bery should contact the police immedi@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ .




Nag@@ old@@ : Fun and games at the summer fe@@ te
Children and young people from the youth work day group@@ /@@ social group work project from the child protection league of Nag@@ old spent eight glori@@ ously happy days with their social workers during the summer camp in N@@ uss@@ dor@@ f@@ , near Müh@@ lack@@ er@@ .
The lively group spent the first week of the school holidays in the peace@@ ful@@ ly@@ -@@ located Hart@@ wä@@ ld@@ le holiday camp@@ .
There were several day trips on the agen@@ da@@ .
One trip saw the group head to Bre@@ tten to visit the pet@@ ting z@@ oo@@ .
Another saw them visit Maul@@ br@@ onn@@ , where there was a special chil@@ dren@@ '@@ s tour around the world@@ -@@ famous clo@@ i@@ ster@@ s.
The third trip took the group to Pfor@@ z@@ hei@@ m.
The group learnt lots about how the Cel@@ ts lived and what they ate in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dor@@ f.
On warm dat@@ es@@ , the group cooled off at the Tiefen@@ see lake in Maul@@ br@@ onn@@ : perfect for jumping in@@ to@@ , swimming around in@@ , and pad@@ d@@ ling@@ .
Children and carers cooked their own favourite me@@ als@@ , such as mini German sp@@ ätz@@ le dum@@ pl@@ ings in a sour sau@@ ce@@ , traditional Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le and I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Blo@@ ff@@ , English break@@ fast@@ , and Tü@@ bin@@ gen@@ -@@ style b@@ olo@@ gn@@ es@@ e.
During work@@ shop@@ s@@ , children could practise bak@@ tik@@ , make beautiful jewellery with pearls and st@@ ones@@ , or create a Roman wind@@ mill game from woo@@ d.
Other highlights of the summer camp included fishing in a nearby pon@@ d@@ , spending the evenings around a camp@@ fire@@ , and the concluding "@@ Gala Night@@ "@@ .
When it came to go home@@ , the sun was sh@@ ining@@ , and the children and young people headed home happ@@ y@@ .




Hai@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch@@ : Pil@@ gri@@ ms at the gates of mercy
The mini@@ stran@@ ts from the chap@@ la@@ inc@@ y of Ey@@ acht@@ al@@ -@@ Hai@@ ger@@ loch St. Anna went on a four@@ -@@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Frei@@ bur@@ g.
They covered four stages toge@@ ther@@ .
The committee of upper mini@@ stran@@ ts for St. Anna had decided to prepare for and go on a pilgrimage lasting several days to bridge the gap to the next pilgrimage to Rome for all mini@@ stran@@ ts@@ , likely to take place in two year@@ s@@ ' time@@ .
Various pilgrimage sites were disc@@ us@@ sed@@ , and a decision was finally made to go to the bis@@ hop@@ '@@ s city of Frei@@ burg@@ , where@@ , to mark the holy year of mer@@ cy@@ , this year the gates of mercy opened for this at Freiburg cathedral are a particular pilgrimage site@@ .
16 children from Bit@@ tel@@ br@@ onn@@ , Gru@@ ol@@ , Hai@@ ger@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern set off@@ .
On the previous even@@ ing@@ , Father Stor@@ ost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna@@ , blessed the pilgri@@ ms@@ ' cross and the pilgri@@ m@@ s.
They took the train from Hor@@ b to the starting point of Vil@@ lin@@ gen@@ , where the Cathedral of Our Lady is found@@ . They started their pilgrimage from the cath@@ ed@@ ral@@ .
The individual day trips were framed by brief moments every morning and evening with various pra@@ y@@ ers@@ , songs and written tex@@ ts@@ .
Even when they were out and ab@@ out@@ , the children took breaks at way@@ side cross@@ es@@ , chap@@ els or churches to sing a song from the pilgri@@ ms@@ ' song@@ book they had put together them@@ sel@@ ves@@ .
The rec@@ tory of each parish they reached was available for them to stay in over@@ night@@ .
At each sta@@ ge@@ , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller were responsible for creating a deli@@ ci@@ ous@@ , nour@@ ishing dinner and break@@ fast@@ .
The second day saw them head towards Gü@@ ten@@ bach@@ , via Fur@@ tw@@ an@@ gen@@ .
The next day@@ , they set off on the section towards St. Peter@@ , the most demanding sec@@ tion@@ , seeing them climb around 500 metres in altitude in s@@ wel@@ tering he@@ at@@ , and then descend aga@@ in@@ .
They earned the reward of barbe@@ cu@@ eing together by the swimming pon@@ d.
After the morning session on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive clo@@ ist@@ ers of St. Peter@@ , they started off on the final stage to Frei@@ bur@@ g.
The children gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afterno@@ on@@ , visibly relieved and happ@@ y@@ , and passed through the gates of mer@@ cy@@ .
A brief moment was taken to thank Go@@ d.
The evening mass in the cathedral saw the children who had arrived at the pilgrimage site welcomed by Cha@@ plain Markus Ober@@ t.
After the service@@ , the pilgrims were able to visit the sacri@@ stry and the high al@@ tar@@ .
The next day@@ , there was time to look around the city@@ , located in the region of Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ .
In the afternoon they took the train back to Hor@@ b.
At the end@@ , all the participants agreed that the trip was characterised by spirituality and a strong sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie@@ .




Sco@@ t Call@@ um Skinner storms home as Br@@ its grab cycling gold
Scot@@ land@@ '@@ s Call@@ um Skinner ra@@ ced to glory in the men@@ '@@ s team sprint at the Rio vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 201@@ 2.
The Glas@@ we@@ gian 23@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scot@@ s@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made his own and the young@@ ster did the legend proud as he stor@@ med home to s@@ nat@@ ch victory from the favoured New Zealand out@@ fit@@ .
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Ho@@ y claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold@@ s.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a low@@ ly sixth at March@@ '@@ s Track World Championships in London@@ , despite Ho@@ y having since reti@@ re@@ d.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff@@ .
They did so just in time as Hin@@ des emer@@ ge@@ d.
Ho@@ y@@ '@@ s retirement also created a void which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to fill@@ .
Skinner was the man Brit@@ ain@@ '@@ s coaches stuck with@@ , seeing potential in the Sco@@ t which has now been reali@@ se@@ d.
Hin@@ des@@ , Kenny - champions with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in quali@@ fy@@ ing@@ , but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round@@ .
And the British trio won the du@@ el for gol@@ d.
Hin@@ des was narrowly behind after his lap@@ , but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on@@ .
A change of strategy was a big part of the transform@@ ation@@ , with Hin@@ des riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and@@ , in partic@@ ular@@ , Skinner to keep p@@ ace@@ .
Ho@@ y watched on from his position as a BBC pun@@ dit and caught the eye of Sk@@ inner@@ , Kenny and Hin@@ des when they stepped on to the po@@ di@@ um@@ .
The 23@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old Sk@@ inner@@ , from Glasgo@@ w@@ , sa@@ id@@ : "@@ It@@ '@@ s a flat@@ tering compar@@ ison@@ .@@ "
I@@ '@@ m just out there to do my best and make a name for my@@ sel@@ f.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champi@@ ons@@ .
It was just incredi@@ ble@@ .
There@@ '@@ s no better way to win it@@ .
After trium@@ ph@@ ing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Ho@@ y@@ , Hin@@ des admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor star@@ t.
He later re@@ tracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Brit@@ ain@@ '@@ s rival@@ s.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme vic@@ tor@@ y@@ .
Hin@@ des sa@@ id@@ : "@@ It felt like London@@ , with all the GB flags in the stand@@ .@@ "
We all as a team came together in the last three mon@@ th@@ s.
We@@ '@@ ve been losing out on so many world tit@@ les@@ , so to win the Olympics again is just amaz@@ ing@@ .
That is one event@@ , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London@@ .
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five mon@@ th@@ s@@ , then a successful five days in the vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me awa@@ it@@ s.
With the form Kenny demonstr@@ at@@ ed@@ , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Ho@@ y@@ '@@ s feat of winning three Olympic gol@@ ds in one Gam@@ es@@ .
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y@@ , who is also born on 23 March (@@ that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Red@@ grave@@ , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster@@ ) - take his t@@ ally to six gold medals and one sil@@ ver@@ .
That would be the same as Ho@@ y@@ '@@ s.
Kenny next compet@@ es in the sprin@@ t@@ , which begins on today and plays out over three da@@ ys@@ .
The 28@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old from Bol@@ ton sa@@ id@@ : "@@ I@@ '@@ m just enjoying this one for no@@ w.
The team event is always the best@@ .
You get to win it with your mat@@ es@@ .
It@@ '@@ s a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest@@ .
Hin@@ des sa@@ id@@ : "@@ If he wins another two gold med@@ als@@ , he should get a kni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood@@ .@@ "
It was the day@@ '@@ s only medal event@@ , but there was further good news for Brit@@ ain@@ .
Sir Brad@@ ley Wi@@ gg@@ ins@@ , Ed Clan@@ cy@@ , Steven Burke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified fastest in the four@@ -@@ man@@ , four@@ -@@ kilometres team pursu@@ it@@ .
They finished in 3@@ :@@ 5@@ 1.@@ 94@@ 3.
The world record@@ , set in winning gold at London 201@@ 2@@ , is 3@@ :@@ 5@@ 1.@@ 65@@ 9.
The first round and final (@@ 10.@@ 4@@ 2@@ p@@ m@@ ) take place on to@@ day@@ '@@ s second day of ac@@ tion@@ , where Wi@@ ggins is sure to be the foc@@ us@@ .
He had a dispute with c@@ ommis@@ sa@@ ires yesterday ahead of the qualification ri@@ de@@ , when officials summ@@ oned him to measure his hei@@ ght@@ .
In the corresponding wom@@ en@@ '@@ s event@@ , which resu@@ mes and concludes tom@@ or@@ row@@ , Laura Tro@@ tt@@ , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie advanced in a world record time@@ , clo@@ cking 4@@ :@@ 13.@@ 26@@ 0@@ .
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of med@@ al@@ s.
After truly exceptional show@@ ings of utter dominance at Beijing and London@@ , expectations have been played down in the le@@ ad@@ -@@ up to Ri@@ o.
There have been dra@@ mas in the back@@ ground@@ , not least the resignation of technical director Shan@@ e Sut@@ ton in April amid sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying alleg@@ ations@@ , and the reti@@ rements of giant figures like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , on the evidence of the first night@@ '@@ s racing in the vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me@@ , it looks like GB@@ '@@ s now legendary reputation for pe@@ aking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once aga@@ in@@ .




Portland smel@@ ter@@ '@@ s future in doubt with ax@@ ing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smel@@ ter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant dis@@ closing one of the plant@@ '@@ s owners is to terminate a supply contrac@@ t@@ , with all supply contracts expected to be ax@@ ed@@ .
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation@@ .
A 20@@ -@@ year fixed subsidy expires in Nov@@ ember@@ .
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alco@@ a@@ '@@ s Portland plant@@ .
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any clo@@ su@@ re@@ .
And there could be additional kno@@ ck@@ -@@ on effects since the smel@@ ter consumes around 10 per cent of Victori@@ a@@ '@@ s entire electricity out@@ put@@ .
In 201@@ 4@@ , Alcoa closed the Point Henry smel@@ ter which led to the closure last year of the An@@ gl@@ es@@ ea power plant@@ .
Alco@@ a@@ '@@ s Portland smel@@ ter is losing money and risks clo@@ su@@ re@@ .
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now@@ , initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant@@ .
AG@@ L@@ , which supplies the big aluminium smel@@ ter with electricity from its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in the Lat@@ ro@@ be Valle@@ y@@ , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agre@@ e@@ ments@@ .
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alum@@ in@@ a@@ , with Chin@@ a@@ '@@ s CIT@@ IC and Jap@@ an@@ '@@ s Mar@@ u@@ beni Corp holding smaller sha@@ res@@ .
"@@ AG@@ L expects the Portland facility to continue to oper@@ ate@@ , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smel@@ ter will continu@@ e@@ ,@@ " it sa@@ i@@ d.
AG@@ L said the contracts are so@@ -@@ called '@@ hed@@ ging contrac@@ ts@@ ' which were due to take effect from November 201@@ 6.
The contracts have a 12@@ -@@ month termination period so they will actually finish in 201@@ 7.
"@@ As such@@ , AG@@ L continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17,@@ " the power company sa@@ i@@ d.
Any potential earnings impact on AG@@ L from FY@@ 18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity pri@@ ces@@ .
AG@@ L said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $@@ 187 million in "@@ anticipation of a termination event@@ .@@ "
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "@@ does not affect Alco@@ a@@ '@@ s ... ability to operate the smel@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the smel@@ ter@@ .@@ "
The US company said it entered into a 20@@ -@@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year@@ , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contrac@@ t.
An@@ alysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smel@@ ter in Victoria and also the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
Ad@@ dressing analysts earlier in the week@@ , AG@@ L@@ '@@ s head of oper@@ ations@@ , Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said Portland uses around 600 mega@@ wat@@ ts of power annually and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ wat@@ ts@@ .
If both of those plants go from the market th@@ at@@ '@@ s a significant reduction in demand in the [@@ electri@@ city@@ ] market@@ .
And as a generator that w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n@@ '@@ t be good for us@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.




Not just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star@@ , K@@ end@@ all@@ '@@ s on the cover of Sept@@ ember@@ '@@ s Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jenn@@ er@@ , 20@@ , model and fourth daughter of mother@@ -@@ manager Kris@@ '@@ s Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an@@ -@@ Jenn@@ er c@@ lan@@ , is on the cover of US Vo@@ gu@@ e@@ '@@ s coveted September issu@@ e.
K@@ end@@ all@@ , who is an E@@ stee Lau@@ der brand ambassador and has walked in Mil@@ an@@ , Paris and New York fashion week@@ s@@ , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thurs@@ day@@ .
"@@ In a room with a bunch of people I lo@@ ve@@ , looking at this cover made me cr@@ y@@ ,@@ " K@@ end@@ all w@@ ro@@ te@@ .
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (@@ or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans@@ -@@ es@@ que@@ ?@@ )@@ , scrip@@ ted reality video that featured the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an@@ -@@ Jenn@@ er family (@@ bar trou@@ ble@@ makers Rob and Ca@@ it@@ lyn@@ , and joined by every@@ one@@ '@@ s favourite show@@ biz un@@ cle@@ , Ke@@ eping Up producer Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest@@ ) forgetting about their si@@ ster@@ '@@ s cover@@ , only to end with the classic twi@@ st@@ : they were all planning a surprise part@@ y@@ .
It@@ '@@ s the c@@ liche plot line of nearly every "@@ birth@@ day@@ " episode of a chil@@ dren@@ '@@ s television show (@@ Se@@ ac@@ rest delivers the line@@ , "@@ You thought we forgot about you@@ ?@@ ,@@ " with the sincerity of a cartoon rab@@ bit in an 8@@ am tim@@ es@@ lot@@ )@@ , but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity someh@@ o@@ w.
Bec@@ au@@ se@@ , with a spot on Vo@@ gu@@ e@@ '@@ s September issu@@ e@@ , we have surely entered a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an@@ .
K@@ end@@ all@@ '@@ s big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vo@@ gue (@@ she shared it with husband K@@ any@@ e West in April 201@@ 4@@ )@@ , but the magaz@@ ine@@ '@@ s September cover is a league unto it@@ sel@@ f.
The September Issu@@ e is Vo@@ gu@@ e@@ '@@ s highest selling edition of the year@@ .
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magaz@@ ine@@ , the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (@@ Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista counted 6@@ 15 of last year@@ '@@ s 8@@ 32@@ -@@ page tom@@ e as advertising cont@@ ent@@ )@@ .
The revelation of its cover star is so hot@@ ly anticipated th@@ at@@ , in the past two year@@ s@@ , pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announ@@ ce@@ ment@@ .
Pre@@ vious women to feature on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell@@ , Linda Evangeli@@ sta and Kate Mo@@ ss@@ .
In recent year@@ s@@ , the cover has certainly featured more "@@ celebrities who model@@ " than "@@ models who are celeb@@ ri@@ ti@@ es.@@ "
Oscar winner and Di@@ or ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 201@@ 3@@ , the year after Lady G@@ aga had the hon@@ our@@ .
But@@ , even on the off@@ -@@ chance that Ms Jenn@@ er - who is described by the magazine as the "@@ break@@ out model@@ " of her generation - falls into the former categor@@ y@@ , she is in pretty good comp@@ any@@ .
These celebrities are not relatives of famous pe@@ op@@ le@@ , or reality star@@ s@@ , or kids these days who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video (@@ although Jenn@@ er is all of these th@@ ings@@ )@@ .
They are legitimately talented wom@@ en@@ , excell@@ ing in the entertainment indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
Bey@@ on@@ ce@@ , who appeared on last year@@ '@@ s cover@@ , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade@@ .
Of cour@@ se@@ , not everyone is pleased about Jenn@@ er@@ '@@ s success@@ .
With her reality television histor@@ y@@ , Jenn@@ er@@ '@@ s position within the fashion world was always going to be frau@@ ght@@ .
In Jun@@ e@@ , original Victori@@ a@@ '@@ s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our criticised Jenn@@ er and her colleague Gi@@ gi H@@ adi@@ d@@ , calling them the "@@ bit@@ ches of the moment@@ .@@ "
This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenn@@ er@@ '@@ s Vo@@ gue cover appe@@ ar@@ anc@@ e.
But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the poin@@ t.
K@@ end@@ all Jenn@@ er is on the cover of the September Issu@@ e of Vo@@ gu@@ e.
She is a super@@ model@@ , in the pu@@ rest sense of the wor@@ d.
She@@ '@@ s walking for Marc Jacob@@ s.
She@@ '@@ s selling you E@@ stee Lau@@ der found@@ ation@@ .
She@@ , and all of her si@@ ster@@ s@@ , are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ walled app@@ s.
She@@ '@@ s selling pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ d@@ '@@ s daughter she photographed to LO@@ VE magaz@@ ine@@ .

Community legal centres turn away 16@@ 0,000 people a year
More than 16@@ 0,000 of the nation@@ '@@ s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year@@ , with the sector bra@@ cing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on al@@ read@@ y@@ -@@ stretched oper@@ ations@@ .
In Queens@@ land@@ , three out of five people - mostly the el@@ der@@ ly@@ , im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts@@ , vulnerable work@@ ers@@ , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair e@@ vic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and represent@@ ation@@ .
Community legal servi@@ ces@@ , already stretched beyond limit@@ s@@ , are bra@@ cing for further cut@@ s.
From June next year@@ , those legal centres are sl@@ ated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal fund@@ ing@@ .
Director of Community Legal Centres Queens@@ land James Far@@ rell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Cen@@ sus Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year@@ .
Mr Far@@ rell said without a reversal of the federal government deci@@ sion@@ , the situation was only going to get wor@@ se@@ .
"@@ Queens@@ land@@ '@@ s community legal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ fun@@ de@@ d@@ , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
People leaving violent relation@@ ship@@ s@@ , people with un@@ manageable and crip@@ pling deb@@ ts@@ , families going through separ@@ ation@@ , workers who are unfairly s@@ acked - all of these people have problems with legal dimen@@ sions@@ , and this report shows that the@@ y@@ '@@ re not able to get the help they need@@ .
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 201@@ 7@@ , which means thousands more vulnerable Queens@@ l@@ anders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without hel@@ p.
We call on the Attor@@ ne@@ y@@ -@@ General@@ , and Queens@@ land Senator George Bran@@ dis to immediately reverse these funding cut@@ s@@ , so people can get the help they need when the@@ y@@ '@@ re faced with a legal proble@@ m.
Last year@@ , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national aver@@ age@@ .
It@@ '@@ s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communi@@ ti@@ es@@ , and for the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government to invest in this important work@@ .




Donald Trump campaign su@@ ed after sta@@ ffer allegedly pulled a gun
New Yor@@ k@@ : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ '@@ s campaign was su@@ ed for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a sta@@ ffer as they drove in a Jeep in Febru@@ ary@@ .
The incident was described in a law@@ suit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordini@@ , a former software trainer for the state campaign@@ .
B@@ ordin@@ i said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "@@ this was not going to happ@@ en.@@ "
The direc@@ tor@@ , Earl Phil@@ lip@@ , "@@ produced a pi@@ stol@@ , put his right index finger on the trig@@ ger@@ , and drove the barrel into Vinc@@ ent@@ '@@ s knee cap@@ ,@@ " B@@ ordin@@ i said in the compla@@ int@@ .
After complaining to local and regional campaign lea@@ der@@ ship@@ , B@@ ordin@@ i learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phil@@ lip@@ , according to the fil@@ ing@@ .
"@@ G@@ uns don@@ '@@ t have to fire to inflict dam@@ age@@ ,@@ " B@@ ordin@@ i said in the compla@@ int@@ .
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a fur@@ ore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "@@ Second Amendment pe@@ op@@ le@@ " -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of jud@@ ges@@ .

Berlin@@ /@@ Schwer@@ in@@ : Pol@@ l ahead of regional elec@@ tions@@ : SPD and CDU lose out
A@@ head of the elections in the federal states of Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vorpommern (@@ 4 Sept@@ ember@@ ) and Berlin (@@ 18 Sept@@ ember@@ )@@ , considerable losses are looming for the governing parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U.
These are the findings of a representative poll carried out by IN@@ SA@@ , a polling institu@@ te@@ , on behalf of "@@ Bild@@ " newsp@@ aper@@ .
While the red@@ -@@ black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to continue in offic@@ e@@ , this will not be possible in Berlin@@ , according to the poll@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the SPD was the strongest party in both states@@ , with good chances of putting forward the head of the govern@@ ment@@ .
In Meckl@@ en@@ burg@@ -@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern@@ , the SPD plum@@ meted from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five year@@ s.
According to the poll@@ , this puts the party only slightly above the CD@@ U@@ , who had 23 percent@@ .
The Left and the Af@@ D will fight over third plac@@ e.
The Left had 19 percent (@@ previously 18.@@ 4 percent@@ )@@ , and@@ , with 19 percent@@ , the Af@@ D could be in the regional parliament for the first time@@ .
Des@@ p@@ ite small losses (@@ from 8.7 percent to 6 percent@@ )@@ , the Greens will return to Schwer@@ in@@ '@@ s regional parlia@@ ment@@ .
The N@@ PD and the FP@@ D@@ , with 3 percent e@@ ach@@ , will not be represented in the regional parlia@@ ment@@ .
According to the poll@@ , the SPD would only receive 23 percent in Berlin@@ '@@ s elections to the House of Representatives (@@ 2011 elec@@ tions@@ : 28.@@ 3 percent@@ )@@ .
The CDU would only take 18 percent@@ , after having taken 23.@@ 4 percent@@ .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator@@ : The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in slow mo@@ tion@@ : The Nokia Communic@@ ator was brought to market 20 years ag@@ o.
Its successors have now conquered the world - but its manufacturer is in the midst of a disa@@ ster@@ .
The device weighed almost half a kilo@@ gram@@ , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thi@@ cker and lar@@ ger@@ , and harder to hol@@ d.
Inde@@ ed@@ , it was quite bul@@ ky@@ .
The in@@ -@@ built storage originally held eight me@@ gab@@ ytes - enough today for around two high@@ -@@ resolution sel@@ fi@@ es@@ .
No@@ w@@ , an iPhone holds at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes@@ .
The "@@ Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator@@ " was released for sale exactly 20 years ago@@ , on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smart@@ ph@@ one@@ .
The device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euro@@ s@@ , even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , 20 years ago@@ , the Communic@@ ator sparked a sensation@@ .
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a couple of months previously at the C@@ ebit computer trade fair in Han@@ over@@ , billing it as "@@ the office you can fit in your po@@ cket@@ "@@ .
The new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back th@@ en@@ : it could send and receive SMS messages and em@@ ail@@ s@@ , and could even be contacted by fa@@ x.
You could even access websites via a HTML brow@@ ser@@ , even though it was painfully slow@@ .
There was a calcul@@ ator@@ , a digital address book and an electronic calen@@ dar@@ .
There was a small anten@@ na@@ , and the phone could be folded open like a lapt@@ op@@ .
This revealed a small keyboard and a black and white screen@@ .
The price was fairly high@@ : 27@@ 00 deutsch@@ mark@@ s@@ , around 1400 euro@@ s.
In 201@@ 5@@ , the average sale price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euro@@ s.
In August 199@@ 6@@ , nobody had any idea that the Communic@@ ator heral@@ ded the start of the smartphone er@@ a.
To@@ day@@ , everything has change@@ d.
Smartphones are a success story - even if the same cannot be said for Nok@@ i@@ a.
The mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disa@@ ster@@ , and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up@@ .
Today the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nok@@ i@@ a.
For many people to@@ day@@ , being online all day@@ , no matter where you are@@ , is simply a fact of life@@ .
In 201@@ 5@@ , there were around two billion smartphone users around the world@@ .
A@@ round 1.4 billion devices were sol@@ d@@ , and Samsung and Apple alone make up 555 million of them@@ .
Global sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euro@@ s.
This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of innumerable app providers and telecommunications fir@@ m@@ s.
An entire industry has now sprung up around smart@@ ph@@ ones@@ .
The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007@@ , when the Apple CEO at the time@@ , Steve J@@ obs@@ , announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World@@ .
He promised three devices in one@@ : a music play@@ er@@ , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator - and everything could be accessed easily via tou@@ chs@@ cre@@ en@@ .
App@@ le@@ '@@ s trium@@ phant march began@@ , and the iPhone is still the comp@@ any@@ '@@ s most important product to@@ day@@ .
Nok@@ ia@@ , Motorola and Black@@ ber@@ ry@@ , who used to dominate the market@@ , lost out@@ .
They eventually dis@@ appe@@ are@@ d@@ , and Black@@ berry had to fight for its exist@@ ence@@ .
App@@ le@@ , and Asian providers such as Sam@@ s@@ ung@@ , now hold s@@ way@@ .
20 years after their in@@ vention@@ , smart@@ phones are a fact of life@@ .
No@@ wa@@ da@@ ys@@ , every German looks at their phone an average of 88 times a day@@ .
"@@ We all need to learn to put our phones down from time to time@@ ,@@ " said Jan@@ ina Kugel@@ , Siemens HR Direc@@ tor@@ .
B@@ eing permanently contac@@ table has become a blessing and a cur@@ se@@ .




Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London@@ , but across the country@@ .
For me@@ , this was the great attraction of Heath@@ row@@ , just as it was with London 201@@ 2@@ , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Gam@@ es@@ .
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East En@@ d.
And@@ , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heath@@ ro@@ w.
For our local communities alone we@@ '@@ ll create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps@@ , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the air@@ port@@ .
Just as there were ahead of London 201@@ 2@@ , there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great@@ .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarra@@ ssed on the world sta@@ ge@@ .
The doub@@ ters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heath@@ ro@@ w.
There are always obstacles to be over@@ com@@ e@@ , but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it@@ .
Like the Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the man@@ y@@ , not just the fe@@ w.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new j@@ obs@@ , £@@ 2@@ 11@@ bn in economic grow@@ th@@ , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK@@ .
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £@@ 11@@ bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget@@ , from T@@ 5 - voted the world@@ '@@ s best airport terminal five years in a row@@ , to T@@ 2@@ , built in the middle of the world@@ '@@ s busiest two run@@ wa@@ ys@@ .
Now they stand ready to deliver a third run@@ way@@ , backed by £@@ 16 billion of private invest@@ ment@@ .
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be to@@ o.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heath@@ row@@ , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud o@@ f.

Ad@@ block Plus@@ , Facebook in "@@ cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ mouse g@@ ame@@ " over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online adverti@@ sing@@ , attempts to circumvent ad@@ -@@ blocking software amount to a "@@ cat@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ mouse g@@ ame@@ ,@@ " according to one of the companies that makes that software@@ .
On Thurs@@ day@@ , just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad block@@ ers on its desktop site@@ , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once aga@@ in@@ .
On Tu@@ es@@ day@@ , Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad block@@ ers to detect which parts of a page are ad@@ s.
But Ad@@ block now says it has gotten around the new co@@ des@@ .
In a blog post@@ , Ad@@ block spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "@@ this sort of back@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ forth battle between the open source ad@@ -@@ blocking community and circum@@ ven@@ ters has been going on since ad blocking was invent@@ ed@@ ,@@ " and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix so@@ on@@ .
The fact that the world@@ '@@ s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad block@@ ers have become for the indu@@ str@@ y@@ .
Glob@@ all@@ y@@ , roughly 200 million people use ad blo@@ cker@@ s@@ , according to a study last year from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Ado@@ be@@ ; nearly quadru@@ ple the number who used such software in 201@@ 3.
With 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile de@@ vic@@ es@@ , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ '@@ s advertising reven@@ ue@@ .
The company is going after ad block@@ ers on desktop ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , because mobile ad block@@ ers are not effective in Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ '@@ s mobile apps for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m@@ , a spokesperson sa@@ i@@ d.
Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the invest@@ ment@@ .
Also on Tu@@ es@@ day@@ , Facebook said it would be updating its "@@ ad prefer@@ en@@ ces@@ " tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them@@ .
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block@@ '@@ s new filters were concerning because they would also block some non@@ -@@ advertising content on the site@@ .
"@@ This is@@ n@@ '@@ t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issu@@ e@@ ,@@ " a Facebook spokesperson said in an e@@ -@@ mailed state@@ ment@@ .
Ad block@@ ers are a blunt instru@@ ment@@ , which is why we@@ '@@ ve instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in pe@@ op@@ le@@ '@@ s hand@@ s.




Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night@@ .
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suici@@ de@@ .
The incident happened on the A1 near Mor@@ ges in the canton of V@@ aud just after midnight on Thurs@@ day@@ .
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "@@ in a desperate act@@ " and was hit by several vehi@@ cl@@ es@@ , V@@ aud police said in a state@@ ment@@ .
Cle@@ arly looking to kill her@@ self@@ , the vic@@ tim@@ , a Swiss woman aged 49@@ , was hit by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry@@ .
She died at the scen@@ e.
Sever@@ al of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still uni@@ denti@@ fi@@ ed@@ , said poli@@ ce@@ , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forwar@@ d.
A criminal investigation has been open@@ ed@@ , a "@@ logi@@ cal@@ " step in a situation like th@@ is@@ , lawyer Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter told Le Tribune de Gene@@ ve@@ .
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face char@@ ges@@ .
Was it possible to avoid imp@@ act@@ ?
That@@ '@@ s what the prosecutor must determin@@ e@@ ,@@ " said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter@@ .
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held respon@@ si@@ ble@@ .
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motori@@ sts cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night@@ , said the paper@@ .
Last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pa@@ yn@@ erne one night in August 201@@ 4.
The 22@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road@@ , the court he@@ ard@@ .
The court found that the poli@@ ce@@ woman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "@@ completely exceptional and unpredictable situ@@ ation@@ ,@@ " the judge sa@@ i@@ d.
Any@@ one with information about Thurs@@ day@@ '@@ s incident near Mor@@ ges should call police on 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 4@@ 4.




NASA climate model@@ : Venus was once hab@@ itable
Venus was likely once habit@@ able@@ , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model@@ .
Scienti@@ sts at NAS@@ A@@ '@@ s God@@ dard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Ven@@ us@@ ' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scienti@@ st@@ s.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Ven@@ us@@ , with its hot@@ , water@@ -@@ less surface and CO@@ 2@@ -@@ cho@@ cked atmosp@@ here@@ , might have once hosted Earth@@ -@@ like condi@@ tions@@ .
Scienti@@ sts have previously suggested that Ven@@ us@@ ' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosp@@ here@@ .
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have bo@@ asted a thin@@ , Earth@@ -@@ like atmosphere and still sp@@ un slow@@ ly@@ .
The model also looked at the topo@@ graphy of early Ven@@ us@@ .
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth@@ , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and guard against rapid evapor@@ ation@@ .
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent di@@ mmer@@ .
"@@ In the G@@ ISS model@@ '@@ s simul@@ ation@@ , Ven@@ us@@ ' slow spin exposes its day@@ side to the sun for almost two months at a time@@ ,@@ " G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a news rele@@ as@@ e.
This war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clou@@ ds@@ , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar he@@ at@@ ing@@ .
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth@@ '@@ s to@@ day@@ .
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothe@@ sized by planetary scienti@@ st@@ s.
Th@@ ough likely once habit@@ able@@ , Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light@@ .
Its oceans evapor@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light@@ .
As its hydrogen escap@@ ed@@ , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a de@@ ath@@ ly greenhouse gas effect -- th@@ us@@ , the Venus we know to@@ day@@ .
Rese@@ arch@@ ers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Ge@@ op@@ hysical Research Let@@ ters@@ .




Patrick Roy re@@ signs as Aval@@ anche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ anche on Thurs@@ day@@ , citing a lack of a voice within the team@@ '@@ s deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making process@@ .
Colorado executive vice pre@@ sident@@ /@@ general manager Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immedi@@ at@@ el@@ y@@ .
"@@ For the past three year@@ s@@ , I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Aval@@ anche with ener@@ gy@@ , passion and determin@@ ation@@ ,@@ " the 50@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old Roy said in the state@@ ment@@ .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level@@ .
To achieve th@@ is@@ , the vision of the coach and V@@ P@@ -@@ hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organiz@@ ation@@ .
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team@@ '@@ s perform@@ anc@@ e.
These conditions are not currently met@@ .
Sak@@ ic@@ , who hired Roy on May 23@@ , 201@@ 3@@ , thanked Roy for his contributions to the team@@ .
"@@ Patrick informed me of his decision to@@ day@@ ,@@ " Sak@@ ic sa@@ i@@ d.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the fut@@ ure@@ .
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the le@@ ag@@ ue@@ '@@ s best coach during his ro@@ ok@@ ie season with the Aval@@ anche in 201@@ 3@@ -@@ 14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a fir@@ st@@ -@@ place finish in the Central Divi@@ sion@@ , but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs and has missed the post@@ season in each of the last two year@@ s.
The Aval@@ anche posted a 39@@ -@@ 39@@ -@@ 4 mark in 201@@ 5@@ -@@ 16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild@@ -@@ card spot in the Western Con@@ fer@@ ence@@ .

North Sea oil workers resume tal@@ ks@@ , suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of tal@@ ks@@ , lead negotiators sa@@ i@@ d.
Stri@@ kes against oil@@ field services company Wood Group have been staged spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Sh@@ ell@@ .
"@@ Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current disp@@ u@@ te@@ ,@@ " a joint statement read@@ .
We will hold a number of full@@ -@@ day meetings over the next few week@@ s@@ , starting early next week@@ , to take a fresh look at the issu@@ es@@ .
The labor unions said their recent ac@@ tion@@ , which they said is the first in more than 25 year@@ s@@ , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent@@ .
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pres@@ su@@ res@@ .
The comp@@ any@@ '@@ s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for on@@ shore contractors in 201@@ 4.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market down@@ turn@@ .
Sh@@ ell@@ , for its part@@ , has tri@@ mmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations in the wake of its mega@@ -@@ merger with British energy company BG Grou@@ p.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil pri@@ ces@@ , an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union@@ .
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a gener@@ ation@@ .
The North Sea@@ , he sa@@ id@@ , is vital for the regional econom@@ y@@ .
"@@ In the North Sea and right across the country@@ , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the fe@@ w@@ ,@@ " he said in a state@@ ment@@ .

Ke@@ pler measures spin rates of stars in P@@ lei@@ ades cluster
The latest mission by the Ke@@ pler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades clu@@ ster@@ .
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rat@@ es@@ , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet form@@ ation@@ .
"@@ We hope that by comparing our results to other star clu@@ ster@@ s@@ , we will learn more about the relationship between a star@@ '@@ s mass@@ , its age@@ , and even the history of its solar system@@ ,@@ " Luisa Re@@ bull@@ , a research scientist at Cal@@ tech@@ '@@ s Infra@@ red Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ aden@@ a@@ , said in a news rele@@ as@@ e.
The P@@ lei@@ ades cluster is situated 4@@ 45 light@@ -@@ years from Earth@@ .
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood@@ , having been born roughly 125 million years ag@@ o.
The@@ y@@ '@@ re spinning as fast as they ever will@@ .
At their peak spin rat@@ es@@ , these mat@@ uring stars e@@ ject large amounts of stellar win@@ d.
As these winds travel across the star@@ s@@ ' magnetic fiel@@ ds@@ , they enact a braking effect on the star@@ s.
As a star ages@@ , its spin rate begins to slow down@@ .
Ke@@ pler measures each star@@ '@@ s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star@@ spots -- like sun@@ spo@@ ts@@ .
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive star@@ s.
Re@@ bull lik@@ ens the stars to dan@@ cer@@ s@@ , larger ones pi@@ rou@@ etting more slowly than smaller ones@@ .
"@@ In the '@@ b@@ alle@@ t@@ ' of the P@@ lei@@ ad@@ es@@ , we see that slow rot@@ ators tend to be more massi@@ ve@@ , whereas the fastest rot@@ ators tend to be very light star@@ s@@ ,@@ " said Re@@ bul@@ l.
Bec@@ ause the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster is so clo@@ se@@ , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rat@@ es@@ .
"@@ The P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both direc@@ tions@@ , younger and ol@@ der@@ ,@@ " said Re@@ bul@@ l.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how@@ , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their '@@ dance sho@@ es@@ ,@@ ' so to speak@@ .
Re@@ bull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of P@@ lei@@ ades spin rates in three new pap@@ ers@@ , soon to be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journ@@ al@@ .




A controversial baseball star steps down
Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez@@ ' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to bas@@ e@@ , in better da@@ ys@@ .
After his emotional announcement of reti@@ re@@ ment@@ , the 4@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old pro will wear his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es jersey for the last time on 12 August@@ , against the Tamp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys@@ .
"@@ I love this game and this team@@ .@@ "
"@@ I@@ '@@ m saying goodbye to both of them@@ ,@@ " the 14@@ -@@ time All Star Major League Baseball (@@ ML@@ B@@ ) player expla@@ in@@ ed@@ .
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three tim@@ es@@ , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es@@ .
He signed a ten@@ -@@ year contrac@@ t@@ , which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 200@@ 7.
Un@@ til the end of the contract on 31 December 201@@ 7@@ , he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - on full pay@@ .
Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ag@@ o.
With 6@@ 96 home run@@ s@@ , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team (@@ "@@ run@@ s@@ "@@ )@@ , for the Seattle Marin@@ ers (@@ 1994 to 2000@@ )@@ , the Texas Ran@@ gers (@@ 2001 to 2004@@ ) and since 200@@ 5@@ , the Yan@@ ke@@ es@@ , he has reached rather a few mile@@ st@@ ones@@ .
Al@@ ong with Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys@@ , there are only two other baseball players who can boast similar key statisti@@ c@@ s.
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the 4@@ 1@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old cannot be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fam@@ e.
Bec@@ ause no matter how successful Rodriguez - nick@@ named "@@ A@@ -@@ Rod@@ " - was on the pit@@ ch@@ , his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversi@@ al@@ .
As far back as 2009 the super@@ star told ES@@ PN that he had taken banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 200@@ 3.
In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the "@@ bio@@ genesis scandal@@ "@@ .
Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti@@ -@@ ageing clinic in Florida over a period of year@@ s.
After a legal battle@@ , the ban was reduced to 162 mat@@ ch@@ es@@ .
"@@ The league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I@@ '@@ d played for 20 years without a break@@ ,@@ " Rodriguez sa@@ id@@ , summ@@ ing things up@@ .
Even his final days did@@ n@@ '@@ t go off without a ban@@ g.
While many baseball legends take to the great stage over their last few gam@@ es@@ , Rodriguez had to sit on the sidel@@ ines@@ .
"@@ My job is@@ n@@ '@@ t about a retirement tour@@ .@@ "
"@@ My job is about trying to win every g@@ ame@@ ,@@ " stated Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi@@ .
Never@@ thel@@ ess@@ , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez@@ , who was married to actress Cameron Di@@ az and who has been rum@@ oured to have been linked to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hud@@ son@@ , had the support of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ es@@ ' arch rival@@ s@@ , Boston Red So@@ x.
"@@ We want A@@ -@@ Rod@@ ,@@ " the fans sang as they were defeated 4@@ :@@ 9 by Rodri@@ gu@@ ez@@ ' team@@ .




2016 Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ : Chen Xin@@ y@@ i@@ , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first doping cases
Bu@@ st@@ ed@@ : After a sample tested positive for dop@@ ing@@ , wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Ri@@ o.
Rio de Janeiro - the 2016 Olympic Games have been overshadowed by the first official cases of dop@@ ing@@ .
One now@@ -@@ banned athlete had almost won a med@@ al@@ .
The first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competi@@ tion@@ .
Chinese swi@@ mmer Chen Xin@@ y@@ i@@ , 3@@ 000@@ -@@ meter hur@@ dler Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski tested positive in Bra@@ z@@ il@@ , and have been exclu@@ de@@ d. Just before the start of the athle@@ tics competi@@ tion@@ , which has not escaped critic@@ ism@@ , this news comes at a bad time@@ .
The Sunday before@@ , Chen had revealed the presence of the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ ia@@ zi@@ de@@ , which is used to mask dru@@ gs@@ .
The international sport tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time that she had been banned from the Olympic Gam@@ es@@ .
On Sun@@ day@@ , the 18@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old had taken fourth place in the 100m Butter@@ fly final - missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.@@ 09 secon@@ d@@ s.
Chen was supposed to have taken part in the 50m Freestyle he@@ ats on Fri@@ day@@ .
Chen applied to the International Olympic Committee (@@ I@@ OC@@ ) for a hearing and to have her B sample open@@ ed@@ .
The national association is taking the instance "@@ very seri@@ ous@@ ly@@ , and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investig@@ ations@@ ,@@ " quoted Xin@@ hua from a press rele@@ ase@@ : "@@ We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their deci@@ sion@@ "@@ .
For the first time in histor@@ y@@ , the CAS@@ , not the I@@ OC@@ , is responsible for sanc@@ tioning sport@@ speople who test positi@@ ve@@ .
Also overnight in Ri@@ o@@ , the news about Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa@@ '@@ s positive test leaked out@@ , and the 33@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old went on the offensive her@@ sel@@ f.
"@@ I had three test@@ s@@ , all of which were neg@@ ati@@ ve@@ , and my fourth test was positi@@ ve@@ ,@@ " which was "@@ an unbelievable sho@@ ck@@ ,@@ " she said to Bulgarian TV channel BN@@ T.
She said she was innocent and that "@@ the only explanation could be food supple@@ ments@@ ,@@ " the athlete expla@@ in@@ ed@@ .
According to the re@@ port@@ , the banned substance involved was the blood doping chemical EP@@ O.
Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended as a precau@@ tion@@ , and according to BN@@ T@@ , a B sample also tested pos@@ ti@@ ve@@ .
Bulgari@@ a@@ '@@ s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow spoke up immediately to criticise the athle@@ te@@ .
"@@ I do not understand why sport@@ speople do not draw the right conclu@@ sions@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ id@@ : "@@ We Bulg@@ arians are under observ@@ ation@@ , so many have already been ban@@ ne@@ d@@ "@@ .
Al@@ most all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ f@@ ters from the nation@@ , which has been plagued by dop@@ ing@@ , were not allowed to participate in Ri@@ o.
On Friday the case of "@@ Adrian Ziel@@ ins@@ ki@@ " was announ@@ c@@ ed@@ : the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ one three days ear@@ lier@@ , just like his bro@@ ther@@ .
Bot@@ h deny taking it@@ , but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 k@@ g.
A@@ head of the ath@@ let@@ es@@ ' start@@ , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport@@ .
The World Federation IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team@@ , with one exception@@ , for systematic dop@@ ing@@ , and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Ri@@ o.
In swi@@ mming@@ , Chin@@ a@@ '@@ s earlier offence had caused heated disputes between the athletes them@@ sel@@ ves@@ .
Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t@@ , from Fran@@ ce@@ , spoke out har@@ shly against Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang@@ .
"@@ Sun Yang@@ '@@ s pee is pur@@ ple@@ .@@ "
"@@ When I look at the podium for the 200m Fre@@ est@@ yle@@ , I want to throw up@@ ,@@ " Lac@@ o@@ urt said on French radi@@ o.
In addi@@ tion@@ , Sun was at the middle of an argument with M@@ ack Hor@@ ton@@ , from Austra@@ lia@@ .
"@@ I have no time and no respect for drug che@@ ats@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ i@@ d.
Sun tested positive for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine at the Chinese championships in 201@@ 4@@ , but only had to sit out for a thre@@ e@@ -@@ month ban@@ .

Programm@@ ers of ex@@ tor@@ tion malware are currently targeting companies - with success@@ .
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North Ameri@@ ca@@ , the UK and Germany by Mal@@ ware@@ by@@ tes@@ , the malware defence speciali@@ st@@ s@@ , 40 percent of the companies surveyed had fallen victim to one@@ , two@@ , or several attacks involving ex@@ tor@@ tion software in the past twelve mon@@ th@@ s.
In German@@ y@@ , around 20 percent of the companies had already been targeted by a ran@@ som@@ ware attack@@ .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid up the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetrators so that they were able to use their systems and data that had been affected by the attack@@ .
According to Mal@@ ware@@ by@@ tes@@ ' observ@@ ations@@ , it is noticeable that perpetrators are tail@@ oring their ex@@ tor@@ tion software to attacks on corporate net@@ work@@ s.
If they are successful in that domain@@ , the ran@@ som money they can demand is significantly higher than it would be for private user@@ s.
"@@ We are currently seeing harmful software develop terri@@ fy@@ ingly quick@@ ly@@ ,@@ " explains Mal@@ ware@@ by@@ tes@@ ' CE@@ O@@ , Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zyn@@ ski@@ , in an interview with "@@ Die Welt@@ " newsp@@ aper@@ .
In 200@@ 8@@ , most malware programmes were still focused on sending out adver@@ ts@@ .
Then perpetrators discovered ex@@ tor@@ tion software@@ .
Private users were initially the tar@@ get@@ , but the shift to corporate attacks took place terri@@ fy@@ ingly quickly over the past few mon@@ th@@ s.
Ran@@ som@@ ware follows a simple pat@@ tern@@ : Once activated on a user@@ '@@ s computer@@ , it seeks out files that have not been edited for a long time@@ , like Word@@ , Excel or database fil@@ es@@ , as well as image and video archi@@ ves@@ .
The ran@@ som@@ ware encryp@@ ts these fil@@ es@@ , and del@@ etes the originals for goo@@ d.
Fin@@ all@@ y@@ , the software presents the ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ er@@ '@@ s dem@@ and@@ s.
The victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "@@ Bit@@ co@@ ins@@ "@@ , a crypto@@ currency - to get the decryp@@ tion code needed for the fil@@ es@@ .
But while it@@ '@@ s a personal photo database th@@ at@@ '@@ s at play for private us@@ ers@@ , it@@ '@@ s sensitive customer data or project databases needed for the continuation of projects that are the focus for compani@@ es@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , the damage from a ran@@ som@@ ware hit is gre@@ ater@@ .
22 percent of German companies affected reported that they had suffered a fall in turnover due to ran@@ som@@ ware@@ , 13 percent had to cease trading enti@@ rel@@ y@@ , and in one in@@ stan@@ ce@@ , pe@@ op@@ le@@ '@@ s lives were put at risk@@ .
In German@@ y@@ , several hospitals have already fallen victim to attack@@ s@@ , and their patients were placed under serious threat as a result of the loss of medical record@@ s.
"@@ We always tell victims not to pay up@@ : that simply exacerb@@ ates the problem@@ ,@@ " explains K@@ lec@@ zyn@@ ski@@ .
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get their files back@@ .
Fac@@ ed with operations coming to a stand@@ still@@ , it is hard for managers to say no to the perpet@@ rat@@ or@@ s@@ ' dem@@ and@@ s.
Then aga@@ in@@ , the hackers know th@@ at@@ , and do all they can to build up a good rep@@ ut@@ ation@@ .
A recent study saw security researchers from F@@ -@@ Secure examine user interfaces and contact with ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ er@@ s. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more mon@@ ey@@ .
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay using Bit@@ co@@ in@@ , set up freel@@ y@@ -@@ accessible support web@@ sit@@ es@@ , or decryp@@ t sample files for free@@ .
And while private individuals are targeted for sums of a few hundred euro@@ s@@ , companies sometimes have to bargain hard and pay out fi@@ ve@@ -@@ figure sums to get their files back decryp@@ te@@ d.
Fac@@ ed with the potentially high and relatively risk@@ -@@ free profits from ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ , hackers are becoming more and more profession@@ al@@ , splitting up their work@@ , explains security expert Chester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from antivirus provider S@@ opho@@ s@@ : "@@ An individual can write a ran@@ som@@ ware program within about a week@@ .@@ "
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , it is more likely that three or four people will be invol@@ ved@@ .
The programmers then sell their malware to the actual ex@@ tor@@ tioners in the form of a set of software building block@@ s.
Malware kits to date@@ , including the malware it@@ self@@ , advice and additional tool@@ s@@ , have been sold for a one@@ -@@ off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dol@@ lar@@ s.
"@@ The kits include an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be construc@@ ted@@ , and the appearance and branding can be change@@ d@@ ,@@ " says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski@@ .
The ex@@ tor@@ tioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between vic@@ tim@@ s.
We live in a service econom@@ y@@ .
So you just log into an underground for@@ um@@ , buy the set from a crimin@@ al@@ , and task someone else with installing the software on as many PCs as possi@@ ble@@ .
There@@ '@@ s a payment made for every computer infec@@ te@@ d.
"@@ Norm@@ all@@ y@@ , criminals then task spam@@ mers with distribu@@ tion@@ ,@@ " explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski@@ .
No@@ w@@ , many companies are aware of the risks of ran@@ som@@ ware@@ , and they are protecting their data better@@ .
More than 50 percent of compani@@ es@@ ' IT specialists in May@@ ware@@ by@@ tes@@ ' survey relied on using file back@@ -@@ ups and scanner software to beat ran@@ som@@ ware@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , perpetrators are already trying out new strategi@@ es@@ .
"@@ If simply encryp@@ ting files is@@ n@@ '@@ t enough of a threat to make an ex@@ tor@@ tion request be gran@@ ted@@ , the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive files in@@ stead@@ , such as customer list@@ s@@ , or price calcul@@ ations@@ ,@@ " explains Mal@@ ware@@ by@@ tes@@ ' CE@@ O@@ , Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zyn@@ ski@@ .
This means that the risk potential is much higher than before@@ , depending on the type of fi@@ le@@ .
In the fut@@ ure@@ , perpetrators will be able to focus themselves on brand@@ -@@ new targets within the internet of th@@ ing@@ s.
At the Def@@ con h@@ acker confer@@ ence@@ , security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet@@ .
In the midst of winter@@ , many victims would pay a ran@@ som to have their blocked heating turned back on@@ .
In the fut@@ ure@@ , if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of some@@ one@@ '@@ s he@@ at@@ ing@@ , ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a issue in Industry 4.@@ 0@@ .




Some@@ thing for every situation
H@@ ON@@ DA HR@@ -@@ V is practical and perfect for everyday use
Honda wants to cra@@ m everything into the small HR@@ -@@ V@@ : a bit of an SU@@ V@@ , a bit of a coup@@ é@@ , bundled up with the versatility of a mini@@ van@@ .
It seems a bit too mu@@ ch@@ , but the HR@@ -@@ V@@ , built on the same new platform as the new Jazz@@ , does indeed prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use@@ .
Although the HR@@ -@@ V@@ , at just 1.@@ 60@@ m tall@@ , seems small@@ , passengers in the front and the back have got plenty of room@@ , it@@ '@@ s not a squeeze at all@@ .
The materials used in the interior are well cra@@ f@@ ted@@ , and have a pleasant appearance - just the surface of the d@@ ashboard lets the side down@@ .
The HR@@ -@@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading spac@@ e.
There is@@ n@@ '@@ t just a boot of 453 l with the seats up@@ , and 10@@ 26 l with the seats down@@ ; there are the "@@ magic se@@ ats@@ " to@@ o.
This is rather less magical than it sound@@ s@@ : the seats in the back can be fli@@ pped up like cinema seats to reveal additional loading spac@@ e@@ , measuring 1.@@ 24 m from floor to c@@ ei@@ ling@@ .
The boot is easy to lo@@ ad@@ , but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 200@@ 8@@ , which is a comparable model@@ .
The 1.6 l diesel engine we test@@ ed@@ , with 88 kW@@ /@@ 120 horse@@ power accelerates the HR@@ -@@ V power@@ ful@@ ly@@ , thanks to the torque of up to 300 N@@ m across a wide range of speed@@ s.
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , it could certainly do its work a bit more quiet@@ ly@@ .
Every@@ day consumption of 4.7 l@@ /@@ 100 km was pleas@@ ing@@ .
There is an additional motor@@ : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW@@ /@@ 130 horse@@ power@@ .
All@@ -@@ wheel drive is not avail@@ able@@ .
Its handling is bal@@ anc@@ ed@@ , a good compromise between speed and comfort@@ .
The steering could be a bit more direc@@ t@@ , ho@@ we@@ ver@@ .
In the top@@ -@@ flight "@@ Execu@@ ti@@ ve@@ " ver@@ sion@@ , which we test@@ ed@@ , the fittings leave nothing to be desi@@ re@@ d.
The safety systems include city emergency braking assistant (@@ functions up to a speed of 32@@ )@@ , collision warning system@@ , and the lane departure warning system@@ .
The collision warning system is irrit@@ ating occa@@ sion@@ all@@ y@@ : when par@@ king@@ , it sees lots of obstacles as "@@ approaching objec@@ ts@@ "@@ .
The high@@ -@@ beam assistant system is very reli@@ able@@ .
And the intelligent speed regulator reacts to traffic sign@@ age@@ , and reduces the vehi@@ cle@@ '@@ s speed if necess@@ ary@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , full connectivity is only available for the top@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ range model@@ : 7 inch tou@@ chs@@ cre@@ en@@ , sat@@ nav@@ , app integr@@ ation@@ , and more@@ .
There are two USB ports and a HDMI port under the arm@@ rest@@ , which makes them rather tricky to access@@ .
It costs around 29@@ ,000 euros for a top@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ range diesel model@@ , which is fair@@ .
If you don@@ '@@ t want to invest quite that mu@@ ch@@ , the petrol model is available from 20,000 euro@@ s@@ , and diesel from 23@@ ,000 euro@@ s.
The motors comply with euro 6 emissions standard@@ s.
With the HR@@ -@@ V@@ , Honda is offering a diverse car that is perfect for everyday dri@@ v@@ ing@@ .




Airline is not li@@ able@@ : Fall on passenger boarding bridge
An airline will not be liable for a passen@@ ger@@ '@@ s fall on a passenger boarding bri@@ d@@ ge@@ .
This is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel@@ , the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued (@@ A@@ z.@@ : 18 U 124@@ /@@ 14@@ )@@ .
The claim@@ ant had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was one of the ordinary risks of life@@ , pronounced the cour@@ t.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compens@@ ation@@ .




When do organisers pay if illness stri@@ kes@@ ?
Trav@@ ellers who fall ill will only get their money back when they return home if there is no doubt that their illness was caused by something within their hotel@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , this is only the case if more than ten percent of visitors can be proved to have suffered the same symptom@@ s.
In this cas@@ e@@ , a family were stricken with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their holiday in Tur@@ key@@ .
They spent almost all their holiday in their room@@ .
The holiday@@ makers blamed a mal@@ functioning sewage treatment plant@@ , which they believed to have polluted the sea@@ water@@ .
The family took the opinion that the holiday was unsatisfactory - and took the organiser to cour@@ t.
The claim@@ ants had no luck in cour@@ t.
It was true that the waste treatment plant was suffering from a faul@@ t.
But the organiser only found out about this just before the claim@@ ants de@@ parte@@ d.
Un@@ til that date@@ , the organiser had to assume that the sea@@ water was accep@@ table@@ .
According to the jud@@ ge@@ ment@@ , the organiser had not violated its information oblig@@ ation@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , no contamination was found in water sam@@ pl@@ es@@ .
When several hotel guests fall ill - possibly by infec@@ ting each other - the court views this as a general life risk@@ .
Only 38 of 6@@ 91 guests fell ill@@ .




De Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that many people were worried about further attacks following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in J@@ ul@@ y@@ .
He said that the state must react to the threat of terrorism with prudence and resol@@ ve@@ .
One thing is for su@@ re@@ : Our country will not react to the perpet@@ rat@@ or@@ s@@ ' violence with hatred and divi@@ sion@@ .
We will not give the terrorists this vic@@ tor@@ y@@ .
If perpetrators have to leave the country quick@@ er@@ , that will boost security and increase the general public@@ '@@ s approval of refugee politic@@ s.
De Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants the proposals to be implemented before the federal elections in 201@@ 7.
He also announced that security services would receive more staff@@ , to the tune of "@@ a mid@@ -@@ four figure sum over several year@@ s@@ "@@ .
Advertising for terrorism must be punishable once aga@@ in@@ .
Video surveillance is to be impro@@ ved@@ , and gun laws to be amended so that purchasing weapons on@@ line@@ , in partic@@ ular@@ , is made more difficul@@ t.
Doc@@ tor@@ s@@ ' confidentiality oblig@@ ations@@ , recently the subject of much disc@@ us@@ sion@@ , are to remain@@ , according to De Ma@@ izi@@ è@@ re@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , he wants to talk to doctors to find solutions to reduce the risk to the general public with regard to mental ill@@ ness@@ , he sa@@ i@@ d.
The Minister felt that improved social care was important to counteract the radicalisation of refuge@@ es@@ .
Te@@ achers must be better trained for dealing with traumati@@ sed individu@@ al@@ s.
De Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to employ under@@ cover agents to hunt down criminals in particular areas of the Internet (@@ the Dark Web@@ )@@ .
SPD Head Gabriel said that "@@ the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further@@ "@@ .
He said it was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against ac@@ tion@@ ism@@ .
"@@ That was a sla@@ p in the face for agit@@ ators in the CD@@ U@@ /@@ CS@@ U@@ ,@@ " said Gabriel on Friday to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group@@ .
De Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously turned down calls from the coalition for a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual nation@@ ali@@ ty@@ .
He views an overarching ban of full v@@ eils as problematic under the constitu@@ tion@@ .
You can@@ '@@ t ban everything you@@ '@@ re opposed to@@ , and I@@ '@@ m opposed to the wearing of the bur@@ ka@@ .
We can talk about the law with regard to traff@@ ic@@ , or for witnesses appearing in cour@@ t.
Head of the Gre@@ ens@@ , Simone Peter@@ , accused the Minister of wanting to use new anti@@ -@@ terror packages to create an air of energy and ability to act@@ .
Head of the Le@@ ft@@ , Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger@@ , said that "@@ smooth talking and tightening up residency laws are not going to make the people in this country any more safe@@ "@@ .




Better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road
Traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here@@ '@@ s a photo from Nov@@ ember@@ .
But that is about to change@@ : the right@@ -@@ hand turning lane is to be exten@@ de@@ d.
This is good news for all drivers stuck in rus@@ h@@ -@@ hour traffic on the bypass every evening as they drive onto the motorway slip road (@@ A@@ 43@@ )@@ .
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (@@ 16@@ /@@ 17 August@@ )@@ , the State Road@@ works Office will exten@@ d@@ the right@@ -@@ hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit from Wes@@ eler Straße by 700 met@@ res@@ .
This means that drivers will be able to feed in directly from Hammer Straß@@ e.
The major advantage is that traffic will split ear@@ lier@@ , improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 5@@ 1.
The CDU fraction in the Münster (@@ West@@ ) district administration came up with the idea to leng@@ then the ex@@ it@@ .
The traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5@@ pm and 7@@ p@@ m.
On week@@ da@@ ys@@ , the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Alber@@ slo@@ her Weg - and sometimes even goes over it@@ .
This is caused by the bottlen@@ eck on the B@@ 5@@ 1@@ , just before the exit onto Wes@@ eler Straß@@ e.
From here@@ , there is only a single lane of traffic over the motorway bri@@ d@@ ge@@ .
The second lane was removed a good eighteen months ag@@ o.
The reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lan@@ es@@ , particularly the weight of heavy goods vehi@@ cl@@ es@@ .
The relevant authorities cannot say how long this bottlen@@ eck@@ , and the associated rus@@ h@@ -@@ hour traff@@ ic@@ , will last@@ .
It@@ '@@ s going to be a matter of year@@ s@@ : offici@@ all@@ y@@ , the bridge will remain in use until 20@@ 3@@ 4.
The district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right@@ -@@ hand turning lan@@ e@@ , because it will cause del@@ ay@@ s.
Traffic will be diverted past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wedn@@ es@@ day@@ .




Intercultural jour@@ ne@@ y@@ : Cultural programme for schools
The international class from the forest school has been to see "@@ The In@@ visible Hou@@ se@@ " at the theat@@ re@@ .
The "@@ Ni@@ ma@@ '@@ s@@ " association and Young Theatre are now planning a musical projec@@ t.
The "@@ Ni@@ ma@@ '@@ s@@ " association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Mün@@ ster@@ .
The "@@ International Cl@@ ass@@ " at the Kinder@@ haus forest school saw a performance of the awar@@ d@@ -@@ winning play "@@ The In@@ visible Hou@@ se@@ " at the Young Theatre in Mün@@ ster@@ .
Wi@@ thin the framework of the "@@ Intercultural Jour@@ ne@@ y@@ " set up by Ni@@ ma@@ '@@ s@@ , 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 saw the play in the small house@@ .
The associ@@ ation@@ '@@ s objective is to encourage cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee back@@ ground@@ s@@ , and since the start of the year@@ , it has offered schools with welcome classes with the chance to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this projec@@ t.
Most young people in the class arrived in Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghani@@ stan@@ , Iran@@ , Serbia and Syri@@ a@@ , among other@@ s@@ , and spoke little German@@ .
Thanks to the chore@@ ogra@@ phy@@ , scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the plot regar@@ d@@ less@@ , according to the press release from Mün@@ ster@@ '@@ s Young Theat@@ re@@ .
Ni@@ ma@@ '@@ s@@ , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ kel@@ , and the Young Theat@@ re@@ , will work on a musical theatre project together over the next season@@ .
From October to Dec@@ ember@@ , young people aged between 14 and 20 with and without a migrant and refugee background will have the chance to attend profession@@ all@@ y@@ -@@ led courses for sing@@ ing@@ , dan@@ c@@ ing@@ , act@@ ing@@ , and musi@@ c.
There are also plans for acting and theatrical language training for children and famili@@ es@@ .
The "@@ Intercultural Jour@@ ne@@ y@@ " project continu@@ es@@ .
As a result of the increase in the number of refuge@@ es@@ , the association is expecting that many classes will want to take part@@ .




Rain replaces shooting star@@ s@@ : There is hope that the weather will improve
For people hoping to spot shooting stars in south@@ -@@ west Germany on Thursday night@@ , the weather put paid to their plans - but all is not lo@@ st@@ .
The President of the Observatory of Wel@@ z@@ heim@@ , Hans@@ -@@ Ulrich Keller@@ , said on Friday morning that the clouds and rain overnight meant that conditions were not ideal for observing the celestial sho@@ w.
We are p@@ inning our hopes on Friday night@@ .
The weather is supposed to be good@@ , so we@@ '@@ ll definitely see lots of shooting stars in the sky@@ .
The shooting stars are the Per@@ sei@@ ds@@ : some of the quickest shooting star@@ s@@ , travelling at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometres an hour@@ .
Thei@@ r name refers to the fact that they seem to come from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us@@ , which is visible in the north@@ -@@ east@@ .




Silent night@@ : Tips to fight sleep disorders
In the evening your mind won@@ '@@ t stop whir@@ ring@@ , you lie awake for hours each night@@ , and by the time morning com@@ es@@ , sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off@@ .
This is anything but relax@@ ing@@ .
If you suffer from these issu@@ es@@ , you@@ '@@ re in good comp@@ any@@ : According to the Robert Koch Institu@@ te@@ , around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep dis@@ order@@ s@@ , and more than ten percent find that they often or always wake up not feeling refresh@@ ed@@ .
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest them@@ sel@@ ves@@ ?
There are various forms of sleep dis@@ order@@ s@@ , and they can have many caus@@ es@@ , emphasises Hans@@ -@@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß@@ , President of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medic@@ ine@@ .
What people generally understand by sleep disorders is insom@@ ni@@ a@@ : a problem with falling asleep and sleeping through the night@@ .
Many people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or in@@ adequ@@ ate@@ , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht@@ , Member of the Board of the German Association of General Prac@@ ti@@ cion@@ ers@@ , who practices in V@@ arel in Lower Sax@@ ony@@ .
What is behind sleep dis@@ order@@ s@@ ?
The causes of sleep disorders are comple@@ x.
Bi@@ ologi@@ cal@@ , psychological or behavioural factors can be to bl@@ ame@@ , along with medic@@ ation@@ .
A sleep disorder is often a reflection of another ill@@ ness@@ .
"@@ W@@ aking up very early is common with depres@@ sion@@ , in partic@@ ular@@ ,@@ " says We@@ e@@ ß@@ .
And it can be the case that several factors have an impact on each other@@ .
If you have a slipped disk@@ , for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , you might find it hard to lie down@@ , wake up every couple of ho@@ urs@@ , and start to g@@ rum@@ ble about everyday problems and wor@@ ri@@ es@@ , suggests We@@ eß as an ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .
That causes ten@@ sion@@ , and it is impossible to sle@@ ep@@ .
When should you see your doctor about sleep dis@@ order@@ s@@ ?
If@@ , over the course of a mon@@ th@@ , you sleep poorly for at least three nights a week@@ , and find that this impacts you during the day@@ , you should see a doc@@ tor@@ , advises We@@ e@@ ß@@ .
They can impact in various different wa@@ ys@@ : You could be exhau@@ st@@ ed@@ , ti@@ red@@ , poorly rest@@ ed@@ , suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying aler@@ t@@ , be irrit@@ able@@ , have mood swings or physical compla@@ ins such as stomach ache or heada@@ ch@@ es@@ .
To be able to treat a sleep dis@@ order@@ , it is important to work out what is causing it@@ .
Behavi@@ our chan@@ ges@@ , cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - with traditional sleeping tablets only being used in exceptional circumstances and for a maximum of two weeks - are all options for treat@@ ment@@ .
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in German@@ y@@ , emphasises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e@@ , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Centre in Berlin@@ .
As a resul@@ t@@ , you should first turn to your GP if you@@ '@@ re suffering with a sleep dis@@ order@@ , recommends We@@ e@@ ß@@ .
Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a physical cau@@ se@@ .
Who should go to a sleep lab@@ , and what happens there@@ ?
Doc@@ tors recommend an examination in a sleep lab for patients whose snor@@ ing disrup@@ ts their breath@@ ing@@ , for people who feel ab@@ normally sle@@ ep@@ y during the day@@ , for sle@@ ep@@ wal@@ ker@@ s@@ , or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be pin@@ poin@@ ted@@ , explains Fi@@ etz@@ e.
You don@@ '@@ t have to prepare for the examination at all@@ .
You should spend the day norm@@ all@@ y@@ .
"@@ Just - please don@@ '@@ t take an afternoon nap@@ ,@@ " says Fi@@ etz@@ e.
After being c@@ abled up@@ , you head to bed at your normal time@@ .
In addition to the electro@@ des on the body@@ , you wear a nas@@ al can@@ nu@@ la@@ , a belt across your chest and a sensor on your finger@@ .
In addi@@ tion@@ , a camera mounted on the ceiling records the sle@@ e@@ per@@ .
How can those affected get a grip on the problems they are experi@@ enc@@ ing@@ ?
There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a better night@@ '@@ s sle@@ ep@@ .
We@@ eß lists them@@ : going to bed and getting up a regular tim@@ es@@ , not staying in bed too long@@ , not sleeping during the day@@ , not watching television to get to sle@@ ep@@ , avoiding alco@@ hol@@ , and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight awa@@ y@@ , and th@@ at@@ '@@ s not helpful at all@@ .




What the jungle camp has got to do with missing swimming medals
Former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ eib@@ ler has posted on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DS@@ V team at the Olymp@@ ic@@ s.
In December 2014 he got his first gold medal at the Short Course Swimming Championships in Do@@ ha@@ , while setting his first world record@@ .
Now the former DS@@ V athlete Markus D@@ eib@@ ler has come forward on Facebook to defend his ex@@ -@@ te@@ amm@@ ates from critic@@ ism@@ .
"@@ In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jung@@ le gets 150,000 euro@@ s@@ , nobody should wonder why medals ar@@ en@@ '@@ t being won@@ ,@@ " the 26@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook pa@@ ge@@ .
The remuneration system in swimming is poor@@ , but doping test@@ s@@ , on the other hand@@ , are very good@@ , he sa@@ ys@@ .
This means that we cannot compete with countries who pay a lot and that don@@ '@@ t pay as much attention to dop@@ ing@@ , or even encourage it@@ .
"@@ I@@ '@@ m not saying that we should stop our test@@ s@@ ,@@ " he went on to expla@@ in@@ .
If he wanted to make a com@@ eb@@ ack@@ , D@@ eib@@ ler would have to register with the National Anti@@ -@@ Doping Agency for Germany (@@ N@@ AD@@ A@@ ) nine months before he star@@ te@@ d.
This is exactly how it should be with coun@@ tri@@ es@@ .
"@@ If you don@@ '@@ t submit to W@@ AD@@ A@@ /@@ FIN@@ A checks a particular amount of time before the World Champi@@ on@@ ship@@ s@@ /@@ Olymp@@ ic@@ s@@ , then you sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ n@@ '@@ t be able to take part@@ ,@@ " the Hamburg resident stat@@ ed@@ , who now runs an ice@@ -@@ cream par@@ lo@@ ur@@ .




Air@@ port@@ : A gang of luggage thieves are arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf airport
Plain clothes officers from Dussel@@ dor@@ f@@ '@@ s police force managed to arrest two women and two men@@ , aged between 50 and 6@@ 1@@ , on Thurs@@ day@@ .
The suspects had worked as a group to steal several bags and items of lug@@ ga@@ ge@@ .
A@@ round 9.30 p.m. civil servants in Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the police from previous th@@ ef@@ ts@@ .
The two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid@@ -@@ J@@ ul@@ y@@ , and had committed the offences as a group@@ , dividing up their work in a particularly professional way@@ .
The specialists from the 3@@ 4th police inspec@@ torate were able to prove that the thie@@ ves@@ , who had travelled to Germany to commit the cri@@ mes@@ , had committed four cri@@ mes@@ .
They had made more than 15,000 euros as a resul@@ t.




Old buil@@ ding@@ s@@ , a couple of little lin@@ den tre@@ es@@ , and a few cob@@ ble@@ stones among them@@ : at first glan@@ ce@@ , Berlin@@ -@@ Friedrichsha@@ in@@ '@@ s Ri@@ ga@@ er Straße do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t look as if it@@ '@@ s one of the streets that the police consider to be among the most dangerous in the city@@ .
If you walk along the street from east to west@@ , you come across play@@ ground@@ s@@ , a freshly painted kindergarten and a heal@@ th@@ -@@ food shop@@ .
Some@@ one has spra@@ y@@ painted "@@ horri@@ d@@ !@@ " on the facade of a house@@ .
Op@@ posite a Li@@ dl@@ , due to be pulled down so@@ on@@ , construction is already under@@ way@@ : by 201@@ 7@@ , a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be construc@@ te@@ d.
Articles on this "@@ trendy di@@ stric@@ t@@ "@@ , as the property company responsible has dubbed Friedrichsha@@ in@@ , have been illustrated with pictures of burning cars over the past few week@@ s.
The reason for this is house 94@@ : At fir@@ st@@ , it was occupied by squ@@ at@@ ters@@ , then the inhabitants had rental contrac@@ ts@@ , but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squ@@ at@@ ters and used for event@@ s.
Berlin@@ '@@ s Senator of the Interior Hen@@ kel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a "@@ no@@ -@@ go z@@ one@@ " for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for autonomous viol@@ ence@@ .
After the rooms on the ground floor@@ , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede@@ , were cleared on 22 June by 300 police offic@@ ers@@ , the police pat@@ rolled the area for three week@@ s@@ , according to official state@@ ments@@ , with 30 to 40 officers and three v@@ ans@@ , closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 9@@ 4.
During this peri@@ od@@ , builders renovated the rooms on behalf of the uni@@ denti@@ fied owner of the house@@ .
On 13 July Berlin@@ '@@ s Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illeg@@ al@@ , and@@ , one day later@@ , police and builders left the site@@ , to the che@@ ers of supporters and re@@ sident@@ s.
On this summer afterno@@ on@@ , the street seemed peace@@ ful@@ : parents were out walking with their chil@@ dren@@ , people were sitting on their hous@@ es@@ ' steps in the sun@@ sh@@ ine@@ , other people were chatting in front of the off@@ -@@ lic@@ ence@@ .
Near the house project there is a primary school and a kinder@@ garten@@ .
Far@@ -@@ left violence is not what worries most residents the mo@@ st@@ : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ gebau@@ er@@ , who has lived in the district since 199@@ 9@@ , and Jan@@ a@@ *@@ , who has brought three children up here@@ , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presen@@ ce@@ .
They share the inhabitants of the housing projec@@ t@@ '@@ s fears of rising rents and gent@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation@@ .
It do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t sound like a district that wants more police protection against le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing van@@ dali@@ sm@@ .
The sch@@ isms that Berlin@@ '@@ s Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up between the squ@@ at@@ ters in the house and their neighbours do not exist@@ .
Friedrichsha@@ in@@ , in the east of Berlin@@ , was traditionally a work@@ ing@@ -@@ class neighbour@@ ho@@ od@@ . Even to@@ day@@ , it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city@@ .
Squ@@ at@@ ters in houses and the residential projects they spa@@ wn are nothing new in the di@@ stric@@ t@@ : in 1990 numerous houses in the th@@ en@@ -@@ GDR were full of squ@@ at@@ ters@@ , including almost all of Main@@ zer Stra@@ ßer@@ , near Ri@@ gau@@ er@@ .
While those on Main@@ zer@@ straße were cleared out during a real street battle with a large police deplo@@ y@@ ment@@ , many of the projects in Ri@@ g@@ auer were leg@@ ali@@ sed@@ , and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squ@@ at@@ ted there 26 years ag@@ o.
At the same time@@ , the district has become more and more of a magnet for tourists and Berlin residents who come from all over the world@@ : residents from GDR times and former squ@@ at@@ ters are now sharing their district with them@@ .
This can be felt in the rent@@ s@@ , which have climbed by almost 60 percent since 200@@ 9.
Many of the new buildings in Ri@@ g@@ auer are seen as symbols of this develop@@ ment@@ : this is clear from their broken windows or freshly painted facades splat@@ tered by paint bom@@ bs@@ .
No other street has been mentioned so often this year in connection with "@@ autonomous le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing viol@@ ence@@ "@@ .
One reason for not all neighbours seeing this as a problem could be that they are not directly affected by cri@@ me@@ : according to statisti@@ c@@ s@@ , almost all crimes such as bodily harm are directed against the poli@@ ce@@ .
The majority of crimes are damage to proper@@ ty@@ , which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated proper@@ ti@@ es@@ .
For Ker@@ stin Neu@@ gebau@@ er@@ , who has been living in a block of flats nex@@ t@@ -@@ door to controversial number 94 for 17 year@@ s@@ , there can be no talk of un@@ certain@@ ty@@ .
She is calm about acts of viol@@ ence@@ : the people at number 94 are her neighbour@@ s@@ , they certainly had nothing to do with it@@ .
Even the notorious burning cars have not played a role in Ri@@ ga@@ er for a long time@@ .
The trained architect does not see her street as a crime flash@@ point - quite the op@@ posi@@ te@@ : "@@ Here we help each other@@ , live together along the street@@ , and talk to each other more than else@@ where@@ "@@ .
Neu@@ geb@@ auer chose to move to Ri@@ g@@ auer Straße - and she chose to stay there@@ .
This is also why it was so important to her that residents got their street back@@ : back from the poli@@ ce@@ , politicians and the media who suddenly started claiming how important the district was in J@@ ul@@ y@@ .
But in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ gebau@@ er@@ , the street is still being taken awa@@ y@@ : by im@@ personal new developments in old empty sit@@ es@@ , which drive out old re@@ sident@@ s.
"@@ They are fre@@ ehold flat@@ s@@ , and most people here ar@@ en@@ '@@ t interested in that - people here generally ar@@ en@@ '@@ t so well@@ -@@ off@@ ,@@ " she sa@@ i@@ d.
"@@ I absolutely cannot con@@ done violence and destruc@@ tion@@ .@@ "
But what should you do when nobody li@@ stens to you@@ ?
Then everyone gets frustr@@ at@@ ed@@ , including the police and re@@ sident@@ s.
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little sympathy for people who have moved in and are irrit@@ ated by paint bom@@ bs@@ : The housing project and the le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing scene are part of the di@@ stric@@ t.
If you move here@@ , you should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into an area full of pubs should know they can@@ '@@ t really complain about the nois@@ e.
All people only described using their foren@@ ames have requested that their real names are not used




Ur@@ bach@@ : Anni@@ ka Deut@@ sc@@ le is the new Commissioner for Refugees
Anni@@ ka Deutsch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ ation@@ .
She will also work on@@ -@@ site as a social work@@ er@@ .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Ur@@ bach since J@@ ul@@ y@@ .
The social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Gro@@ cken@@ ber@@ ger@@ .
She views herself as a poin@@ t@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ contact for all invol@@ ved@@ : refuge@@ es@@ , people from the working group for refuge@@ es@@ , administr@@ ator@@ s@@ , authori@@ ti@@ es@@ , and anyone else@@ .
Reg@@ ine Kunde from the working group said that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now available to work as a jack@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ all@@ -@@ trades to help anyone experiencing difficul@@ ti@@ es@@ .
That@@ '@@ s what some people said when management posted the adver@@ t for the job - meaning it less in a mo@@ cking way@@ , and more with reference to the number of tasks that were to be perform@@ ed@@ .
They were looking for a manager with people skills and communication skill@@ s@@ , combined with years of experience in social work - a real jack@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ all@@ -@@ tra@@ des@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , managerial work is not how she spends most of her time@@ , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le sa@@ ys@@ .
It is primarily about organis@@ ation@@ , working on@@ -@@ site with pe@@ op@@ le@@ , even in the back@@ ground@@ , and net@@ work@@ ing@@ , she sa@@ ys@@ .
The 31@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old has been in post for around six week@@ s.
She has taken the 50@@ % job for a fixed term of three year@@ s.
It was high time@@ ,@@ " Reg@@ ine Kunde sa@@ id@@ , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le offered support to voluntary and full@@ -@@ time work@@ er@@ s.
There are major problem@@ s@@ , minor problem@@ s@@ , organisational problem@@ s@@ , problems with pe@@ op@@ le@@ , comprehension problem@@ s.
New containers will soon be located in Was@@ enstraße
For a whi@@ le@@ , one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified stat@@ us@@ .
Commun@@ es themselves are responsible for subsequent accommod@@ ation@@ .
They have to house the refugees in their own properties or in rented proper@@ ti@@ es@@ .
Commun@@ es themselves have to bear the costs for construc@@ ting@@ , renting or renov@@ ating this accommod@@ ation@@ .
Responsibility switches from district administration to commun@@ es and job cent@@ res@@ .
The problem@@ : Properties are free@@ , but not every land@@ lord is prepared to let@@ .
The search has been very difficult for a whi@@ le@@ .
De fac@@ to@@ , the administration cannot find any private hom@@ es@@ .
According to Deu@@ schle@@ , being reliant on private homes has not work@@ ed@@ .
This is why the commun@@ e@@ '@@ s homes need to be be@@ ef@@ ed up@@ , as it is so neatly put@@ .
Con@@ sequ@@ ently new containers will soon be located in Was@@ enst@@ ra@@ ß@@ e.
But homes alone will not do the trick@@ .
Perspective is the key word@@ , and Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree on that sco@@ re@@ .
In addition to a fixed abo@@ de@@ , intern@@ ship@@ s@@ , apprentic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps@@ , school plac@@ es@@ , "@@ one@@ -@@ euro@@ " traine@@ eship jobs and temporary jobs need to be found or set up for refugees and mi@@ gran@@ ts@@ .
"@@ More jobs would be good@@ ,@@ " reports Reg@@ ine Kun@@ de@@ .
Many people work in buil@@ der@@ '@@ s yards or help care@@ ta@@ ker@@ s@@ , or do voluntary work - and that provides motivation in a very orderly way@@ , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le re@@ por@@ ts@@ .
She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive public percep@@ tion@@ .
This is not "@@ employment therap@@ y@@ "@@ .
B@@ eing active do@@ es@@ n@@ '@@ t just mean work@@ ing@@ .
The day needs a fixed struc@@ ture@@ , Deu@@ sch@@ le and Kunde say@@ .
People need to develop a sense of belong@@ ing@@ .
Con@@ sequ@@ ently there is a need to provide sports@@ , contact to loc@@ als@@ , and@@ , above all@@ , language cour@@ ses@@ .
Professional courses are ra@@ re@@ .
There is where the administration and volunteers can get invol@@ ved@@ .
She says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in German@@ y@@ .
The length of time that processes take is a proble@@ m.
They have to explain to refugees that it will take that long@@ , and that the time can be filled produc@@ tively - for ex@@ amp@@ le@@ , with language cour@@ ses@@ .
If someone feels that they can@@ '@@ t help anyone in Ur@@ bach@@ , that they ar@@ en@@ '@@ t allowed to work@@ , and that they are us@@ el@@ ess@@ , the@@ y@@ '@@ ll never integr@@ ate@@ .
The clear majority are motiv@@ at@@ ed@@ .
But there are also problem cas@@ es@@ , Kunde says honest@@ ly@@ , "@@ people for whom nothing work@@ s@@ "@@ . As a resul@@ t@@ , Deu@@ sch@@ le and Kun@@ de@@ '@@ s work will always be to motivate other@@ s.
All tol@@ d@@ , this is "@@ a mam@@ mot@@ h tas@@ k@@ "@@ .
A tricky question@@ : After recent event@@ s@@ , are the two women worried about radic@@ alis@@ ation@@ , even in a small commune like Ur@@ bach@@ ?
"@@ No@@ ,@@ " Reg@@ ine Kunde said cle@@ ar@@ ly@@ , "@@ which some people might call nai@@ ve@@ "@@ . She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remain@@ ing@@ .
Ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , volunteers are already aware of th@@ is@@ .
These issues are already discussed by the refuge@@ es@@ .
They were afraid that the attackers would bring them into total dis@@ repu@@ te@@ .
"@@ They want to show they have nothing to do with it@@ ,@@ " Reg@@ ine Kunde sa@@ i@@ d.
Many of them would like to stay in Ur@@ bach@@ .
So full@@ -@@ time and volunteer staff have to keep an eye open for jobs in the town and across the region@@ .
But they always have in the back of their mind that a new group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Ur@@ bach@@ .
Does Germany need a cap@@ ?
Poli@@ ti@@ cians shy away from answering this question@@ .
It is unfair to show them volunteers on site@@ .
"@@ In Ur@@ bach we@@ '@@ ve not got to where we wanted to be quite y@@ et@@ ,@@ " said Anni@@ ka Deu@@ schle@@ .
The situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refuge@@ es@@ .
Reg@@ ine Kunde also makes clear that the residents of Ur@@ bach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date@@ .
Cur@@ rently they amount to around 100 pe@@ op@@ le@@ , predominantly young men@@ .
But when people are in need@@ , you@@ '@@ ve got to help them - and both women agree on th@@ at@@ .
The political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers to be found there@@ .
