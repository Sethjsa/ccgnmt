France : EIB lends EUR 50 million towards construction of Millau Via@@ duct
the vi@@ a@@ duct is the sole part of the A@@ 75 being built under a private concession , with the remainder implemented entirely under the responsibility of the State in view of its role in improving access to the eastern part of the Massi@@ f Central .
given the high investment out@@ lay , the French State has awarded the Eiff@@ age Group , against lev@@ ying of tolls , a 75 @-@ year concession for the project .
the EIB loan will enable the Group to diversify resources earmarked for financing the bridge and to improve their cost .

EIB grants EUR 120 million loans for small- and medium @-@ scale investment projects in Hungary
global loans are credit lines to financial intermediaries ( partner Banks ) , which on @-@ lend the proceeds under their own management , at their own risk and own conditions for small or medium @-@ scale investment projects meeting EIB &apos;s criteria .
long @-@ term global loans of the EIB allow the partner banks to increase and diversify their long @-@ term funding sources and to step @-@ up their longer @-@ term financing of projects .
the range of EIB &apos;s partner banks also means more choice and should result in better service and lower financing costs for the final beneficiaries which are typically SMEs and public or private promoters of infrastructure projects .
the EUR 50 million loan to CI@@ B will be used for financing small- and medium @-@ sized projects in the field of environmental protection , energy savings , infrastructure , industry , services or tourism .
by financing more than the usual 50 percent of project costs , EIB is providing an incentive for fast implementation and completion of investment projects .
the loans to K &amp; H and I@@ EB will benefit from the SME Finance Facility , a special scheme promoted by the European Commission .
it provides EIB &apos;s partner banks with an incentive in the form of a specific contribution for supporting the development of a strong and competitive SME sector in the Accession Countries .
the two banks will be the first EIB partner banks benefiting from the SME FF in Hungary .
at the signing of the loans EIB Vice President , W. Roth , said : &quot;
the global loans will serve many purposes at once .
at the same time , they will contribute to the development of long @-@ term finance in Hungary which is crucial for financing of investment and catching up economically . &quot;
note to the editor :
the European Investment Bank , the financing arm of the European Union , has the task of supporting EU policies .
in 2001 , the Bank granted loans totalling EUR 3@@ 6.8 billion , of which 31 billion within the EU .
the EIB is re @-@ financing its lending by issuing bonds on the international capital markets .
due to its AAA credit rating it is able to raise funds at the keen@@ est terms .
being a non @-@ profit institution , the Bank passes on these terms to public and private project promoters as well as partner banks .
since 1990 the EIB has lent over EUR 19 billion to the Centr@@ al- Eastern European Accession countries and has become the region &apos;s most important foreign source of finance .

EIB EUR 225 million for road transport in Turkey
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term financing institution , is providing a loan of EUR 225 million to the Republic of Turkey , represented by the Under@@ secretariat of the Treasury for upgrading , rehabili@@ tating and extending the capacity of priority roads on the main corridors from Istanbul to the South and Eastern parts of Turkey .
this is the first major EIB loan in Turkey in the road transport sector .
it is in line with the objective of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mandate to support investments in infrastructure , particularly in the transport sector .
the two corridors carry local and international traffic from the EU through the Balkans and Greece , to the South of Turkey , as well as to the Eastern Black Sea region .
the first road scheme concerns some 134 km between Ada@@ pa@@ z@@ ari and Bo@@ zü@@ y@@ ü@@ k , on a major north @-@ south corridor .
the second road scheme , which is located between Ankara and Sam@@ sun , the major Turkish city on the Black Sea coast , stretches along some 400 km .
the project will considerably improve transport safety and efficiency and increase capacity .
in a large country such as Turkey , which has the size of France and the UK combined , where 90 % of freight transport and 95 % of passenger transport are done by road , the importance of a sound road network for solid economic progress is paramount , especially as traffic volume is rapidly increasing .
the new Facility for Euro @-@ Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) is endowed with increased financial resources .
this will enable the EIB gradually to scale up its annual lending activity in the region from EUR 1.4 billion to EUR 2 billion .
the new Facility will accord priority to financing private @-@ sector projects with the dual aim of liberalising the Mediterranean Partner Countries &apos; economies and expanding their potential in the run @-@ up to the EU @-@ MPC Customs Union in 2010 .
in this connection , the EIB &apos;s objective is to bolster the proportion of financing it devotes to private @-@ sector projects to 33 % .
qualit@@ atively , the Facility places emphasis on FDI and private sector activity , as well as on social @-@ sector projects , particularly health , education and environmental protection , in the belief that this will make for social stability and encourage economic growth .
in Turkey , EIB has contributed to@@ date with more than EUR 2 billion towards projects of key importance for the Turkish economy .
in the last years EIB finance went mainly for the earthquake reconstruction efforts .
additionally EIB funds have financed mainly projects in the environment sector .
the EIB has also promoted private sector and in particular SMEs , through global loans to local commercial banks .
in human factor development , the Bank has financed the education framework project for the establishment of IT classrooms all over Turkey .

Spain : EUR 110 million for investment in the Asturias Region
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term financing institution , announces a EUR 110 million loan to the Autonomous Community of Asturias for financing infrastructure and industrial investment forming part of the Integrated Operational Programme for the region approved by the European Commission .
this is the EIB &apos;s second operation to co@@ finance a regional development programme in Spain , having granted a similar loan to Andalusia in September 2002 .
this type of operation bol@@ sters the EIB &apos;s close cooperation with the European Commission and local authorities in achieving the EU &apos;s objectives in less favoured regions .
in this instance , the funds made available to the Asturias Region will serve to round off , on optimum terms , the financing of regional investment projects already attracting EU structural funds under the Community Support Framework for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
the operation will assist the development of this Objective 1 region on the north @-@ east coast of Spain with a population of over 1 million .
note to editors :
specifically , the EIB supports viable projects promoting : development of the Union &apos;s less favoured regions ; construction of trans @-@ European transport , telecoms and energy networks ; the international competitiveness and integration of Europe &apos;s industry , especially SMEs ; environmental protection and improvement ; security of the Union &apos;s energy supply ; and health and education .
within certain limits , the EIB also provides financing outside the Union in support of the EU &apos;s policy of cooperation with third countries .
owned by the EU Member States , the EIB funds its lending operations through borro@@ wings raised on the capital markets , where its bond issues systematically enjoy the top AAA rating .
in 2001 , the EIB signed loans in Spain totalling EUR 4 5@@ 59 million .
EIB grants EUR 100 million loan to Bank Pek@@ ao for financing small- and medium @-@ scale projects in Poland
the global loan to Bank Polska Kas@@ a Opi@@ ek@@ i S.@@ A ( Bank Pek@@ ao ) and / or Pek@@ ao Leasing Sp@@ . z o.o. serves to finance small- and medium @-@ scale projects in the field of environmental protection , energy savings , infrastructure ( incl. health and education infrastructure ) , industry , services or tourism in Poland .
final beneficiaries are , typically , SMEs ; and private or public promoters of any size and ownership for energy , environmental protection or infrastructure projects .
support to SMEs is a key priority during the remaining pre @-@ accession phase and will continue to be of high importance post enlargement .
at the same time , it will contribute to the development of term finance in Poland , which is crucial for financing investment and catching up economically .
the loan will allow the Pek@@ ao group to increase and diversify long @-@ term funding sources and therefore to step up its longer @-@ term financing of eligible projects .
furthermore , the global loan to Pek@@ ao which enjoys the second largest branch network in the country - will ensure continued competition among intermediaries throughout Poland , resulting in better service for the final beneficiaries and lower financing costs .
the loan is the first operation with Bank Pek@@ ao , the second largest bank in the whole Central and Eastern European ( CEE ) region in terms of assets .
Pek@@ ao &apos;s main strategic shareholder is Uni@@ Credi@@ to Italiano .
note to the editor :
over 1 billion went to Trans @-@ European road and rail networks ( TENs ) , with emphasis on upgrading major international road and railway axes .
telecommunications , gas and larger industry schemes also attracted substantial loans from the EIB .
small and medium @-@ scale industrial investments as well as smaller energy or infrastructure projects are being further@@ ed through credit lines ( global loans ) to commercial banks established in Poland .
the EIB also helped rebuild infrastructure damaged during the 1997 O@@ dra and 2001 Vi@@ st@@ ula floods .
in the last years , EIB has undertaken efforts to better establish the global loan product in Poland .
global loans now represent 15 % of EIB total lending to Poland of over EUR 5.5 billion .
while this is above the accession countries &apos; average of 13 % , it is substantially below the EU average , reflecting the still more difficult operating environment and the lower development of term lending to SMEs and small municipalities in comparison with the EU .

EUR 31 billion went to projects within the EU Member States and close to EUR 3 billion to those in the Accession Countries , while lending in other countries ran to EUR 3 billion .
to fund these activities , the EIB borrowed EUR 32 billion on the world &apos;s capital markets .
in the Mediterranean region the EIB operates under the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership , which complements the EU Member States &apos; own bilateral co @-@ operation policies .
under the second financing mandate of the Euro @-@ Med Partnership covering the period 2000 @-@ 2006 , the EIB is to provide EUR 6 425 million for projects in the 12 Mediterranean countries , which have signed co @-@ operation or association agreements with the EU .

operational by Autumn 2002 , this Facility foresees increased financial resources , leading the EIB to expand gradually its annual lending in the region from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 billion .
since 1995 , the EIB has contributed some EUR 800 million towards projects of key importance for the Turkish economy .
EIB finance for infrastructure went mainly for environmental projects and the earthquake reconstruction effort .

2001 a record year for EIB lending in mediterranean partner countries : EUR 1.5 billion
active in the region since 1974 , the EIB has granted loans worth over EUR 9 billion in the &quot; Barcelona Process &quot; countries .
its annual rate of lending has continued to grow , rising from EUR 680 million in 1996 to almost EUR 1.5 billion in 2001 , thus positioning the EIB as one of the leading sources of bank financing for the sustainable development of the 12 Mediterranean Partner Countries .
its loans cover all sectors of the economy : the EUR 7.4 billion advanced over the past six years ( 1996 @-@ 2001 ) broke down as follows 1 ) 27.@@ 6 % for supporting the private sector ; 2 ) 24.@@ 6 % for safeguarding the environment ; 3 ) 26.@@ 4 % for harnessing and distributing energy resources ; 4 ) 2@@ 1.5 % for communications .
three priorities for sustainable development
under the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership , Bank activity in support of the beneficiary countries &apos; policy of economic development and openness focuses on three priorities :
such backing for the private sector is designed to boost the competitiveness of the Mediterranean Partner Countries &apos; economies with a view to creating a free trade area with the Union by 2010 .
it takes the form of long @-@ term loans and risk capital ( especially for SMEs ) made available to companies in close cooperation with the local banking and financial sector , so contributing to its modernisation .
in 2001 , 25 % of EIB loans supported this objective in Tunisia , Egypt , Turkey and Malta via an investment fund operating throughout this area .
this activity , which in the 1996 @-@ 2001 period represented on average a quarter of annual lending , rose dramatically in 2001 to account for 34 % of loans ( EUR 580 million ) .
in particular , the EIB financed the improvement of drinking water supplies in 70 medium @-@ sized municipalities in Morocco , the Sahel region in Tunisia and Greater Al@@ giers , as well as the modernisation of wastewater management in Turkey .
at the same time , EIB loans help to bolster and expand economic infrastructure communications , energy laying the foundations for development .
the EIB focuses in particular on financing the establishment of physical links , i.e. regional infrastructure facilitating &quot; South @-@ South &quot; cooperation and trade , the movement of persons and the use of common resources .
in 2001 , lending for such infrastructure accounted for 24 % of loans and targeted Morocco , Tunisia ( communications ) , Egypt , Syria ( energy ) and Cyprus ( health ) .
in geographical terms , EIB operations up to 2001 have generated a loan portfolio broken down as follows .
actively promoting these three priorities , EIB loans are characterised by the &quot; value added &quot; which they bring by virtue of the role of financial catalyst played by the Bank , whose involvement in a project serves to attract other sources of international , bilateral or local financing .
this value added also takes the form of financial engineering tailored to long @-@ term project requirements .
lastly , the EIB contributes to improving the technical and economic definition of projects by applying the same standards and appraisal criteria in these countries as in the Union .
outlook : helping to revitalise the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership
in line with its role as the Union &apos;s financing institution , the EIB is committed to supporting a shift in the direction of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership towards increased economic and financial cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the region , while deploying new financial instruments .
in particular , the EIB plans to expand its activity in the following areas :
supporting the Union &apos;s action to promote an area of peace and stability throughout the Mediterranean region .
in 2001 , the Bank &apos;s most important operations were in Algeria and Syria , countries with which relations have been renewed or enhanced , as well as in Egypt and Morocco , the prime beneficiaries of EIB loans .
for some time , the EIB has also been making a substantial contribution towards the economic development of the Middle East with EUR 1.9 billion granted over the past six years .
it has especially focused on financing basic infrastructure in Gaza / West Bank , SMEs in Jordan and the West Bank , energy infrastructure in Syria and the reconstruction of Lebanon .
fostering the growth of inter @-@ regional cooperation through its backing for projects which en@@ gender closer ties between the Mediterranean Partner Countries ( &quot; South @-@ South &quot; cooperation ) or with the Union ( &quot; South @-@ North &quot; cooperation ) .
Jordan electrical interconnections , the telecoms interconnection between Jordan and its neighbouring countries , the Euro @-@ Med gas pipeline ( Algeria @-@ Morocco @-@ Spain ) , the Spain @-@ Morocco electrical interconnection , the Europe @-@ Morocco telecoms interconnection , port developments in Morocco , Tunisia , Jordan and Lebanon , as well as Beirut Airport .
underpinning foreign direct investment by the Union in the Mediterranean Partner Countries and the creation of joint ventures between European and local operators .
devising loans for projects with a social dimension : in 2001 , the EIB elected to underpin projects directly assisting populations in difficulty ( drinking water supplies for Greater Al@@ giers ) or improving access to optimal services in the health sector ( Nicosia Hospital ) .
it is actively preparing to expand its operations in the fields of health and education in the Mediterranean Partner Countries .
note TO ED@@ IT@@ ORS :

EIB Group strengthens support for EU policies
the European Investment Bank lent EUR 3@@ 6.8 billion in 2001 for capital investment supporting European Union policy objectives , of which EUR 3@@ 1.2 billion for projects within the EU Member States .
in the Accession Countries , EIB advanced EUR 2.7 billion for investment underpinning preparations for enlargement .
EIB also confirmed its influential role in promoting growth and stability in the Mediterranean region , providing EUR 1.4 billion for projects supporting the modernisation of economies in the European Mediterranean Partnership Countries and EUR 320 million for investment in the reconstruction of the Balkans .
under the framework of the EU &apos;s development and co @-@ operation policies , EIB lent EUR 520 million in the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) Countries , EUR 150 million in South Africa , EUR 178 million in Asia and EUR 365 million in Latin America .
the EIB Group &apos;s venture capital arm , the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) , invested EUR 800 million in venture capital operations and advanced up to EUR 960 million for SME guarantees .
to finance its lending , the Bank raised EUR 3@@ 2.3 billion on capital markets through 148 transactions in 13 currencies .
outstanding borro@@ wings tot@@ alled EUR 176 billion and outstanding loans amounted to EUR 221 billion .
supporting EU policies
in line with this , the Group developed activities to support innovation , high @-@ technology and human capital investment through its &quot; Innovation 2000 Initiative &quot; ( i@@ 2i ) , launched in response to the Lisbon Council ( March 2000 ) .
at the same time , EIB reinforced its co @-@ ordination with the European Commission to further operational synergies in implementing EU policies , signing a Joint Memorandum to boost research and technological innovation , as well as joining forces to promote Europe &apos;s film and audio @-@ visual industries .
the two institutions also co @-@ operated in furthering regional development , Trans @-@ European Networks , environment , entrepreneurship amongst innovative small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , education and health , and in the enlargement and Euro @-@ Med Partnership processes .
under its &quot; i@@ 2i &quot; programme , EIB is to lend up to EUR 12 @-@ 15 billion over the years 2000 @-@ 2003 .
EIB Group contributed to this objective through its long @-@ term loans and the strengthened capacity of the European Investment Fund to support investment helping to reinforce the capital base of innovative SMEs .
EIF &apos;s operations also continued to be actively supported by the European Commission , a major EIF shareholder , particularly in developing facilities for SME guarantees .
lending highlights in 2001
Europe &apos;s less advanced regions
regional development continued to be EIB &apos;s lending priority with aggregate EUR 22.@@ 2 billion in both the EU Member States and the Accession Countries .
within the European Union , EUR 14.@@ 5 billion ( i.e.
in the Accession Countries , a future area of the Union &apos;s regional policy , the Bank provided EUR 2.7 billion .
within the Union , the Cohesion Countries ( Spain , Greece , Ireland and Portugal ) attracted EUR 7 billion of individual loans , while EUR 1.8 billion were advanced for projects in the Eastern Länder of Germany and over EUR 1 billion for Italy &apos;s Mezzo@@ giorno .
noteworthy was the Bank &apos;s first participation in the Community Support Framework Programme ( 2000 @-@ 2006 ) for investment in the Basi@@ lic@@ ata Region of Italy .
innovation and human capital
EIB financing in support of Europe &apos;s information and knowledge @-@ based economy amounted to EUR 5 billion in 2001 .
since May 2000 , EIB has approved EUR 9.1 billion for &quot; i@@ 2i &quot; investment in research and development , information and communications technology networks , dissemination of innovation , the development of entrepreneurship among innovative SMEs , and human capital formation .
EIB launched its first human capital oriented operations in the Accession Countries - in Lodz , Poland , and Nicosia , Cyprus .
the European Investment Fund boosted its venture capital operations in 2001 , despite difficult market conditions .
57 operations were concluded for EUR 800 million in all EU countries ( first operations in Greece and Portugal ) and in 5 Accession Countries .
the EIF &apos;s investment strategy is to concentrate on hi @-@ tech and early stage funds .
its overall venture capital portfolio totals EUR 2.2 billion .
the EIF is now the main investor in the early stage market in Europe , representing a segment where risks are highest , the resources scarce and the strategic needs of the EU most evident .
SME guarantees , which , through their important leverage effect allow banks and financial intermediaries to extend their lending activity to more SMEs , represented EUR 960 million under 39 operations in 2001 .
the total guarantee portfolio now represents EUR 3.3 billion and covers nearly 10 000 SMEs .
environment
it provided also EUR 484 million for environmental projects in Accession Countries .
trans @-@ European Networks ( TENs )
strong support for TENs and other infrastructure of European or regional interest tot@@ alled EUR 7.2 billion .
this brings EIB support for TENs over the last five years to EUR 4@@ 3.6 billion .
other key features were the support for a growing number of Public Private Partnerships , both in EU and Accession Countries , and the launch of a co @-@ operation scheme between the EIB Group and the European Commission for equity investment in TENs projects .
accession Countries
EIB continued to finance projects in the Accession Countries ( including Cyprus and Malta ) , reaching some EUR 2.7 billion in the year , bringing total lending since 1990 to EUR 16.@@ 6 billion .
lending was focused on the preparation of the countries for enlargement .
key importance was attributed , again , to loans in support of the transport and communication infrastructure inter@@ linking the region , and the region with the EU ( 56 % of total lending ) .
special emphasis was given to environmental investments ( 20 % ) in order to help the candidate countries to meet the EU &apos;s environmental standards .
transport and environmental projects have been co @-@ financed , in a number of cases , with grant money from the EU &apos;s ISPA programme .
EIB extended its scope of lending to the health and education infrastructure , which requires substantial investment , and financed first projects in the Accession Countries .
in addition , EIB was offering strong support to foreign direct investment , which contributes to the transfer of both , know @-@ how and capital , into the region .
attempts to consolidate public budgets and national elections in Poland , Romania and Bulgaria delayed public investment decisions .
therefore , total lending in the candidate countries was somewhat below the record volume achieved in 2000 .
as the foremost multilateral financi@@ er in the region , EIB increased its lending in the Mediterranean Partner Countries to EUR 1.4 billion .
priority was given to projects that support the Barcelona Process &apos; objective of promoting economic development in the region .
a special focus was on infrastructure schemes , the protection of the environment and SME development , with EUR 330 million committed in favour of SMEs under global loan allocations .
EUR 580 million went to schemes in the water , energy and infrastructure sectors improving the environment .
the Bank continued to help strengthen the private sector .
EIB is also widening its action into the human capital sectors of health and education , where new projects have been identified .
during the year , the Bank extended the scope of its activities by establishing a &quot; Mediterranean Partnership Facility &quot; under which it is to lend an additional EUR 1 billion by 2007 for large transport , energy and environmental cross @-@ regional projects .
Balkans
EIB made a major contribution in committing up to EUR 320 million in 2001 for a number of key investment projects in the sectors of infrastructure and industry in the Western Balkans ( Albania , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , Croatia , Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and FYROM ) .
special emphasis is being given to financing cross @-@ border regional projects in transportation and energy under the international @-@ sponsored infrastructure programme .
having played a leading role in the co @-@ ordination and financing of the initial Infrastructure Reconstruction programme launched in 2000 , EIB is also to contribute to the new EUR 2.4 billion Regional Infrastructure Package .
its role will in particular relate to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads , rail and power infrastructure .
in 2001 , the Bank also concluded its first global loan agreements with intermediary banks , promoting the modernization of the local financial sector and SME investment .
borrowing highlights in 2001
to finance its operations , the Bank raised EUR 3@@ 2.3 billion through 148 transactions in 13 currencies ( before swaps ) on capital markets .
during the year , EIB continued to strongly support the euro , launching EUR 10 billion in 4 benchmark issues , including a new five billion Global ( 2007 ) .
at the end of 2001 , the euro benchmark yield curve had an outstanding amount of almost EUR 40 billion .
based on market reactions to its EUR 5 billion issue , the Bank was awarded Euro@@ week &apos;s &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ ational bond issue of the Year 2001 . &quot;
resources borrowed before swaps in the three major currencies were : 41 % USD , 32 % EUR and 21 % GBP .
the US Dollar was the prime currency of funding , reflecting the favourable borrowing conditions .
after swaps , the euro accounted for 67 % ( generated partly via currency swaps ) , with GBP at 21 % and USD at 8 % .

comment
René Kar@@ sent@@ i , Director General of Finance , said :
Barbara Bar@@ gag@@ li @-@ Pet@@ ru@@ cci , Director and Head of F@@ unding Department , said :
&quot; demand for our bonds from Czech institutional investors has grown substantially this year , in particular in structured products .
we see this as a testament to the growing depth and sophistication of the market . &quot;
rationale for increasing the Programme
this extension of the Programme gives EIB the necessary flexibility to continue issuing CZK bonds within a Czech legal , regulatory and settlement framework .
about 80 % of the existing facility of CZK 30 bn , originally launched in 1999 , has been utilised to date .
EIB also issues CZK bonds outside the Czech Republic in the international market .
the decision to expand the Programme is based on the expectation of continuing demand for EIB loans in local currency format in the Czech Republic , where EIB is the largest multilateral lender .
projects funded recently include large scale infrastructure projects , such as improvements to major roads and investments required to address last year &apos;s flood damage .
update on EIB issuance in CZK and EU @-@ Acceding Country Curren@@ cies in 2003
so far this year EIB bond issuance in CZK has exceeded CZK 2@@ 1.5 bn , after CZK 7.1 bn last year .
around 60 % of CZK issuance was conducted under the domestic Programme .
issuance in CZK accounted for over half of EIB &apos;s issuance in EU @-@ Acceding Countries this year , which grew sharply to over € 1.2 bn equivalent .
this means EIB remains the largest non @-@ government issuer in the Czech Republic and in the EU @-@ Acceding Countries in aggregate .
EIB &apos;s issuance in the region has to date been focused on CZK , HUF , PLN , SK@@ K .
this strong growth in demand for EIB CZK bonds has in particular focused on longer mat@@ urities and structured products .

Lithuania : the European Investment Bank lends EUR 60 million to the Lithuanian State for investments to be co @-@ financed with EU Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds .
the European Investment Bank will provide a Cohesion and Structural Funds Framework Facility of EUR 60 million to the Republic of Lithuania .
the Facility will be used for co @-@ financing projects fostering the development in the economic and social infrastructure ( co@@ financed by the EU Structural Funds ) and projects in the fields of the environment and trans European networks ( co@@ financed by the EU Cohesion Fund ) .
this Facility will complement EU &apos;s grant support identified by Lithuania and the European Commission under the Single programming Document , and under Cohesion Fund for the period 2004 @-@ 2006 .
it aims at both facilitating and accelerating the implementation of investment schemes responding to the EU policy priorities for the further development of the Lithuanian economy and its faster integration to the EU .
their benefits are expected to be both spread over the country and have cross border effects .
the presence of the EIB , alongside the European Commission , will enhance the EU &apos;s support to a new Member State as well as further the Bank &apos;s support to a large number of investment schemes that in view of their relatively small size might not have direct access to EIB financing .
the EIB lending policies substantially reflect the shared priorities of Lithuania and the EU during the Accession process and beyond .
Mr. Sau@@ li Ni@@ ini@@ st@@ ö , the Vice @-@ President of the EIB whose responsibilities include Sweden , Finland and the Baltic States , who signed the loan today with Lithuanian Finance Minister D@@ alia Grybaus@@ ka@@ ite , commented on the signature saying : &quot;

Commission welcomes the European Investment Bank &apos;s new EUR 500 million initiative to support the Climate Change policy of the EU
the new initiatives will be mainly implemented through project financing activities , both inside and outside the EU .
welcoming the initiative by the EIB Wallström said : &quot;
a De@@ dic@@ ated Financing Facility of € 500 million , for commitment over 2 @-@ 3 years , to provide appropriately structured loan finance for projects sponsored by promoters .
the EIB is also exploring the potential for EIB participation in a carbon equity @-@ type facility .
President Maystadt announced that the Bank will look for partners to develop the various proposals : &quot;
to address the challenges of Climate Change we need a broad coalition , we need to be creative and practical .
the EU has invited countries and many other relevant players to contribute .
the EIB together with partners in the business and financial community will continue to explore and implement new solutions for a sustainable development . &quot;
the carbon market is now a reality , with the EU Emission Trading Directive having entered into force in October 2003 .
the emissions trading scheme starts in 2005 and covers five major sectors of EU industry : power generation , oil refin@@ eries , steel , building materials and pulp and paper .
these account for almost half of the EU &apos;s total carbon dioxide emissions .
it is expected to reduce the costs of EU meeting its Kyoto commitments by about one @-@ third .
the emissions trading scheme is fully compatible with international emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol .
the European Commission &apos;s proposal to link the EU emissions trading scheme to the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s project mechanisms , JI , Joint Implementation , and the CDM , Clean Development Mechanism , will significantly increase the demand for JI and CDM credits and speed up the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol also outside the EU .
120 Countries , representing more than 70 % of the world &apos;s population have ratified the Kyoto Protocol , which is expected to enter into force in the near future .
the Commission remains confident that Russia will ratify the Kyoto Protocol and that the EU emissions trading scheme provides a strong incentives for Russia and other CIS countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol .
the Commission recently presented the Emissions Trading Directive to Russian business and governmental representatives in Moscow and received a very positive response .

the Bank &apos;s experience in Egypt , its longstanding financial relationship with the principal project promoters , the mitigation of the political risks ( under the Euro@@ Med portion of the loan package ) and the Bank &apos;s capacity to attract long @-@ term commercial funding and guarantees on this transaction are viewed as decisive factors by the Government of Egypt and the project sponsors .
the project involves technology transfer to Egypt through the participation of three major international companies .
the gas comes from the West Delta Deep Marine concession and will be dedicated to export , through a 20 @-@ year take @-@ or @-@ pay agreement with Ga@@ z de France , a well @-@ known and experienced LNG off @-@ taker .
priced competi@@ tively , the LNG is likely to find markets also elsewhere in the Union .

EIB invests in regional development
on the agenda : global Lo@@ ans to Finn@@ vera ( EUR 50 million ) and to Municipality Finance ( EUR 50 million ) , the City of Van@@ ta@@ a ( urban infrastructure ; EUR 50 million ) and a loan for EUR 180 million to Sen@@ a@@ ati Ki@@ in@@ tei@@ stö@@ t for building and renov@@ ating higher education and research buildings throughout Finland .
these loan signatures clearly show the EIB &apos;s diversification in Finland with support for small @-@ and medium sized enterprises , ( urban ) infrastructure finance and ( higher ) education .
this financing fits in the EIB &apos;s mission to further the policy objectives of the European Union by making long @-@ term finance available for sound investment .
global loans
these intermediaries select the projects based on agreed criteria .
the Global Lo@@ ans scheme combines the EIB &apos;s funding at favourable terms and the national intermediary &apos;s close relationship and knowledge of the local market .
the Global Lo@@ an agreement with Finn@@ vera for the amount of EUR 50 million is intended to increase the productivity and competitive capacity of SMEs .
the financing is directed at investments in industry and services sectors undertaken by SMEs , most of which will be situated in Assi@@ sted Areas of Finland .
Finn@@ vera , one of the principal finan@@ cers of SMEs in Finland , has already three other Global Lo@@ ans with the EIB that are fully utilised .
the Global Lo@@ an of EUR 50 million to the Municipality Finance Bank will be used to finance local authorities &apos; small and medium @-@ scale investments , primarily in energy , infrastructure , urban renewal , environment , health and education in Finland .
municipality Finance was established by municipalities as a non @-@ profit maximising vehicle with an objective to provide competitive funding for the municipality sector .
urban infrastructure
the City of Van@@ ta@@ a is the final beneficiary of a EUR 50 million loan to adapt , renew and expand the town &apos;s infrastructure and educational facilities to the changes and demographic challenges implied by the continued growth of the city .
due to its location in southern Finland within the Helsinki metropolitan region and national and international communication axes , Van@@ ta@@ a expects a rapid economic development .
the EIB part @-@ financed projects are geared towards sustaining growth in employment , offering improved working and living conditions in the area .
concentrating on urban infrastructure components , they are part of a comprehensive transport development strategy aiming at improving accessibility , at reducing con@@ ge@@ sting with a balanced mix between public and private modes and at containing comm@@ uting distances .
the Finnish Higher Education Institutions project contributes towards a knowledge @-@ based society and is in line with current EU orientations on human capital .
it will provide teaching facilities , which meet modern needs in terms of infrastructure and equipment .
the project also entails an important i@@ 2i ( the EIB Innovation Initiative ) element .
the enhancement of , for instance , biotechnology , micro@@ electronics and the new building for information technology , all feature design to accommodate modern technologies and equipment .
EIB Vice President E@@ wald No@@ w@@ ot@@ ny said : &quot;
I am pleased to note that three of the loans signed , the two Global Lo@@ ans and the loan for Higher Education loan , will support initiatives which are located throughout the country with the bulk of the Global Lo@@ an lending being taken up in assisted Areas . &quot;
by the same token the Higher Education loan will support 12 regional institutions ( including the University of Lap@@ land ) as well as a number of institutions in the Helsinki area such as the Helsinki University of Technology and the Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration .
the AAA @-@ rated European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term lending institution , contributes by means of its long @-@ term loans and capital investments towards the integration and balanced development of its Member States as well as in countries outside the Union .
in Finland , the EIB has extended loans totalling over EUR 7@@ 44 million for infrastructure investments , notably roads , rail@@ roads , bridges and telecommunication as well as investments within the energy , environment and the industry sector .

Slovakia : tripartite Cooperation EIB , EU and H@@ VB To Support SMEs
under this agreement , up to EUR 10 million from a EUR 50 million EIB global loan ( credit line ) granted to H@@ VB Slovakia today will be channelled to selected SMEs , for financing industrial , environmental , energy , infrastructure , tourism , health , education and service projects .
the EU Commission is supporting the scheme with financial incentives in the hope to facilitate the financing of SMEs and to improve their competitiveness .
commenting on the tripartite cooperation , EIB Vice President Wolfgang Roth said : &quot;
the EIB is lending to domestic and foreign direct investors alike in Slovakia .
cooperation with an experienced partner such as H@@ VB Slovakia should help kick off many deals with positive long @-@ term effects in terms of international competitiveness and EU @-@ integration of the Slovak industry .
the participation of the European Commission in the new scheme also helps create a favourable environment for the development of a solid SME sector in the new EU Member@@ s.@@ &apos;
global loans are credit lines to selected partner banks of the EIB , which on @-@ lend the funds at their own risk and terms to small and medium @-@ scale investment projects meeting EIB &apos;s lending criteria .
long @-@ term global loans allow the partner banks to increase and diversify their long @-@ term funding sources and to step @-@ up their financing .
the availability of several partner banks in most future EU Members leads to a healthy competition and better service as well as lower financing costs for the SMEs .
the EUR 50 million global loan signed today brings total EIB len@@ din in Slovakia since 1993 to some EUR 1.@@ 4. billion .

the EIB environmental lending activities in the energy sector cover a wide range of investments , including support for the renewable energy initiatives .
in line with the EU aim of boosting renewable energy production , the EIB has set a target to at least doubling the share of renewable energy in its total energy sector financing over the next five years .
from 1993 to 2002 , the EIB provided more than EUR 2.4 billion in individual loans ( 76 % in the EU and 24 % outside ) in the renewable energy sector .

EIB audiovisual support to Den@@ marks Radio
the European Investment Bank has co @-@ financed the construction of a new production facility for Denmark &apos;s radio and TV programmes .
a ( second ) loan of EUR 94 million ( DKK 700 million ) was given to Dan@@ marks Radio ( DR ) , Denmark &apos;s national broadcasting institution , to allow DR to bring its activities together at one location .
the first loan to DR of EUR 107 million dates back to June 2001 .
the support for this project from the EIB , the EU &apos;s financing institution , fits in with the Bank &apos;s objective to develop new media production facilities in the framework of its Innovation Initiative i@@ 2i .
the backing for this project also endorses EU policies in the audio @-@ visual industry .
the role of public broadcasting has been explicitly acknowledged in the Treaty of Amsterdam and is linked to the democratic , social and cultural needs of each society and to the need to safeguard plurality in mass media .
the Lisbon European Council and the Bank &apos;s Innovation 2000 Initiative ( i@@ 2i ) have emphasised the need to support the development in production and distribution of new media .
the achievement of the EU and the Bank &apos;s objective also requires investments in infrastructure into which future technologies can be installed .
in this context the Danish project is an example .
Dan@@ marks Radio currently produces its radio and television programmes in thirteen locations all over Copenhagen .
a new , up @-@ to @-@ date production facility for radio and TV programmes , located in the Ø@@ re@@ stad development area in Copenhagen , is now under construction .
at the same time , technologically outdated equipment will be replaced in DR &apos;s regional offices in other parts of Denmark .
further investments will be made in new technological developments such as digitali@@ sation and online services .
the new audiovisual programme production centre in Ø@@ re@@ stad , an area planned to become a centre for educational and cultural institutions , is the key element of DR &apos;s overall modernisation for the future .
Mr Tom Bar@@ rett , the EIB Director responsible for Denmark , said : &quot;
this capital investment project demonstrates once more the EIB &apos;s added value and its ability to provide long mat@@ urities for these kind of important projects .
with the signing of this loan , EIB lending to the audio @-@ visual sector now extends to over EUR 500 million since the start of its Innovation Initiative i@@ 2i . &quot;
Mr Jør@@ gen Kle@@ ener , Chairman of the Board of Dan@@ marks Radio said : &quot;
public service broadcasting has an important role to play in promoting cultural diversity , in providing educational programming , in guaranteeing objective and pluralistic information and in supplying quality entertainment .

the investment is part of the efforts to modernise and develop Syria &apos;s ports , as the bulk of the country &apos;s foreign trade is sea borne .
Tart@@ ous together with Lat@@ akia , are the country &apos;s two major commercial ports .
Tart@@ ous serves mainly central and southern parts of Syria , including the capital Damascus .
its port is specialised in certain types of general , roll @-@ on / roll @-@ off and solid bulk cargo .
the construction of a new passenger terminal will contribute to the expansion of the tourism industry in the vicinity of Tart@@ ous .

EIB Laun@@ ches the Cotonou Agreement Investment Facility
the Investment Facility has been established within the Framework of the Cotonou Agreement on co @-@ operation and development assistance negotiated between the 78 ACP States and the European Union .
funds for the Investment Facility come from the resources of the EU Member states .
the Facility is intended to become a self @-@ financing revolving fund .
the Cotonou Agreement lays the basis for the next 20 years of co @-@ operation between the AC@@ Ps and the EU , and gives a special focus to sharing the responsibilities and building a partnership for development .
to manage the business generated by the new Facility , the EIB also announced the opening of three new regional offices in Dakar , Nairobi and Pretoria .
they will offer permanent presence in Western , Eastern and Southern Africa and service the respective business communities in the surrounding group of countries .
in the light of the experience gained , the possibility of opening other offices , notably in the Caribbean and the Pacific , will be examined .
in his remarks , EIB President Philippe Maystadt said : &quot;
encouraging private participation will raise standards of living and create new job opportunities .
the ambitious objectives of the Cotonou Agreement present the EIB with new challenges by highlighting the importance of ensuring both the sustainability and profitability of projects the EIB finances through the Investment Facility .
such a challenge is appropriate for a bank with 45 years of experience financing projects .
the EIB has already built up considerable experience in the private sector in the ACP , as some 45 % of our investments are now already in private sector projects . &quot;
the EIB , established in 1958 by the Treaty of Rome , finances capital investment projects which further the European Union ( EU ) policy objectives .
it also participates in the implementation of the EU &apos;s co @-@ operation policy towards third countries that have co @-@ operation or association agreements with the Union .
the EIB first began financing in the Africa 40 years ago , extending its activities into the Caribbean and Pacific areas 30 years ago .
the Cotonou Agreement between the European Union and 78 ACP States was drawn up in July 2000 with the core objective to reduce and eradicate poverty in ACP states .

Poland : EIB finances land@@ slide protection measures
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term financing institution , is lending EUR 50 million for land@@ slide protection measures in Poland .
promoter of the project is the Office for F@@ lood Dam@@ age Recovery , through Central Government , Regional and Local Authorities .
the Deputy Minister of Finance of Poland Ry@@ sz@@ ard Mich@@ al@@ ski and EIB &apos;s Vice President Wolfgang Roth signed the financing contract this morning at the EIB &apos;s Luxembourg headquarters .
flooding has been a recurring event in the region , with widespread damages as late as in last summer particularly in Austria and in Germany .
Poland was severely hit by heavy rainfall , high flood waters and rapid snow melting during the period 1997 @-@ 2001 , provoking both direct flood damages ( O@@ dra River in 1997 and in the Vi@@ st@@ ula River in 2001 ) and major land@@ slides across the whole territory of Poland .
in August 2002 , recognizing the specific risks posed by land@@ slides , the Polish Government adopted a strategy to address the land@@ slide issue .
the loan signed today will help progress with the implementation of the necessary measures , to protect existing infrastructure and provide a basis for sustainable management of risks associated with natural disasters .
the current EIB project concerns both hard and soft investment schemes to protect vital infrastructure against land@@ slide risk .
although the vast majority of them will be in the Carpa@@ thian mountains in Southern Poland , schemes located elsewhere in the country dealing with the same problem would also be eligible .
physical works will involve land@@ slide stabilisation ( drainage , anch@@ oring , toe erosion protection , etc . ) or infrastructure relocation .
soft measures eligible for funding will include risk mapping , development of early warning systems and land @-@ use planning tools .
note to the Editor :
while the bulk of the Bank &apos;s loans go to projects in the EU , especially in its lesser developed regions , the EIB &apos;s activities in the Accession Countries is growing fast and has already reached some 10 per cent of its lending volume .
protecting and enhancing the environment is one of the top lending priorities .
for the four @-@ year period 1999 @-@ 2002 , the Bank provided EUR 11,@@ 6 billion in financing to countries in Central and Eastern Europe , including EUR 1,7 billion though global loans .
of the financing provided directly by the EIB , 28 % concerned environmental projects .

Romania : EIB lends EUR 131 million for school infrastructure rehabilitation
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) lends up to EUR 131 million for rehabilitation and furnishing of about 1 400 pre @-@ university schools all over the country .
EIB supports this education project for schools in rural ( 80 % ) and urban ( 20 % ) areas of Romania through the Ministry of Education , Research and Youth .
the signing of the project will further pave the way for future long @-@ term co @-@ operation with the country in this sector to decrease the imbalance in access to education between rural and urban areas and between regions .
in general , the project will improve the learning environment all over the country and will contribute to the rationalisation of the network of schools and to the consolidation of part of existing school estate in dila@@ pi@@ dated condition .
it builds up the conditions for delivering good quality education and will consequently contribute towards increasing the stock of human capital in a pre @-@ accession country , which is a critical determin@@ ant of economic prosperity , full employment and social cohesion .
elimination of the physical risk to occupants of damaged schools , reduction of utilities and maintenance costs and contribution to poverty alleviation are only some detailed impacts of this rehabilitation .
the project is an important part of the Romanian educational policy as defined in the Strategy for Development of Education and Training System of the Ministry of Education , Research and Youth .
it is also in line with the priorities set out in the Accession Partnership and the pre @-@ accession strategy agreed between Romania and the European Union , thus another step on the road to full membership in the Union .
it will contribute to the attainment of the acquis communautaire and to the EU objective of promoting the development of a knowledge @-@ based economy in today &apos;s EU Member States as well as in future members .
the project is also supportive of EIB &apos;s core objectives of promoting urban regeneration , social inclusion , and poverty reduction .
it encourages Romania and the EIB to continue the close collaboration and conclude further agreements for the benefit of Romania &apos;s economy and population .
it demonstrates that the EIB supports particularly those regions in Central Eastern Europe , which have larger burdens from the past than others .
note to the editor :
the European Investment Bank , the financing arm of the European Union , finances projects which help implement EU policy in the present and future EU countries as well as in a number of developing nations around the world .
the EIB is re @-@ financing its lending by issuing bonds on the international capital markets .
due to its &apos; AAA &apos; credit rating it is able to raise funds at the keen@@ est terms .
being a non @-@ profit institution , the Bank passes on these terms to public and private project promoters as well as partner banks .
since 1990 , the EIB has lent some EUR 20 billion to the eight Central European Acceding countries ( Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia ) and the two Accession countries ( Romania and Bulgaria ) .
this makes EIB to the most important external source of finance for this region .
in Romania , projects of in total EUR 2.7 million have been financed since 1991 .

FEMIP : official EIB visit to the Egyptian authorities and inauguration of the EIB &apos;s Cairo Office review of FEMIP &apos;s first 11 months of activity
this means that SMEs will receive more than EUR 400 million in long @-@ term and risk capital financing , while EUR 740 million will go to larger firms .
in this connection , I should like to mention the ID@@ KU gas terminal , an example of international cooperation between British Gas , Pet@@ ron@@ as , Ga@@ z de France and Egyptian gas sector operators .
to date , therefore , FEMIP &apos;s priority focus on private sector operations is well established .
FEMIP : 11 months of activity
created to support modernisation of the economies of the Mediterranean Partner Countries , in 11 months FEMIP has already provided more than EUR 1.@@ 65 billion in new loans , with the volume set to reach EUR 1.8 billion in 2003 .
at the same time , FEMIP has placed emphasis on transport infrastructure projects underpinning private sector development in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt , Lebanon and Syria ; power and water supply and distribution in Egypt , Morocco and Tunisia ; improvement of health infrastructure in Syria and Tunisia ; and re@@ modelling of education systems in Jordan and Turkey .
commenting on these results , Vice @-@ President de Fontaine Vive stressed that : &quot;
FEMIP &apos;s successful launch owes a great deal to the close involvement of our Mediterranean partners in the conception and monitoring of projects and to their implementation of reforms needed to create a propi@@ tious environment for private investment .
such participation by the sha@@ pers of economic reform in the Mediterranean is essential if , together , we are to meet the challenge of establishing the Euro @-@ Mediterranean customs union by the year 2010 .
on this point , it is gratifying to observe that , through the diversity of what it can offer financially , FEMIP is providing the partner countries with the products that these economies need to modernise : very long @-@ term loans , risk capital and technical assistance .
the Egyptian authorities fully share this view , as is clear from our discussions and the support they have lent in setting up our regional Office in Cairo . &quot;
increasing the volume of long @-@ term loans granted to businesses directly or to banks for on @-@ lending to SMEs ;
creating new products or new financial arrangements designed to make it easier for businesses to obtain credit , such as leasing and guarantee funds ( from risk capital ) , equity and quasi @-@ equity funding ( participating , conditional and subordinated loans ) ;
providing technical assistance to project promoters and the banking sector , in particular to improve credit risk management and hence SME loan prospects .
inauguration of the EIB Office in Cairo
the EIB delegation also officially inaugurated the Bank &apos;s Cairo regional office , which has been operational since July .
headed by Mr Luigi Mar@@ con and with a constituency spanning the whole of the Near East , the office &apos;s mission , in addition to lia@@ ising with the MPC authorities of the region , is to optimise the process of project identification and monitoring .
another task is to facilitate the implementation of technical assistance both for projects and financial institutions in the beneficiary countries .

Slovakia : EIB loan of EUR 30 million for new motorway section
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) has signed a new loan of EUR 30 million for the construction of a new 25.@@ 8@@ km section of the D1 motorway between Men@@ gus@@ ov@@ ce and Já@@ nov@@ ce in Eastern Slovakia .
the new motorway will form part of the most significant road connection linking the West to the East Bratislava @-@ Z@@ il@@ ina @-@ Ko@@ si@@ ce @-@ Uz@@ gorod section on Pan @-@ European Corridor No V.
the loan signed today represents part of the framework loan of EUR 350 million approved by the Bank in 2002 for the implementation of the Slovak Motorway and Express@@ way Programme under the Slovak Government &apos;s Priority Investment Programme .
the first loan of EUR 68 million in this regard was granted by the EIB in November 2003 for three road construction projects on the D1 motorway and the R@@ 1 express@@ way .
construction of the Men@@ gus@@ ov@@ ce @-@ Já@@ nov@@ ce motorway will be co @-@ financed by the EU Cohesion Fund .
the project includes a number of bridges and one two @-@ tube tunnel ( B@@ ô@@ rik ) with a length of 9@@ 95@@ m .
the new motorway will substantially improve transport safety , increase road capacity between Sv@@ it and Pop@@ rad and provide a better connection to Slovakia &apos;s most attractive tourist destinations : the High Tatras and the Low Tatras .
Mr Ivan P@@ ili@@ p , EIB Vice @-@ President responsible for financial operations in Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Poland , commented : &quot;
the EIB firmly supports the extension and upgrading of the motorway network in the new Member States , especially along priority Pan @-@ European Corri@@ dors that are significant for fostering integration of these countries into the EU Single Market .
the new motorway will improve transport links between the two major Slovak cities of Bratislava and Ko@@ si@@ ce .
it will make Eastern Slovakia more accessible , investing it with greater economic competitiveness , which will have positive implications for economic growth in this less favoured region . &quot;
background :
the prime objective of the EIB , the European Union &apos;s financing institution , is to contribute towards the integration , balanced development and economic and social cohesion of the Member States by financing sound investment .
outside the Union , the EIB supports European development aid and cooperation policies .
since 1990 , the EIB has lent a total of some EUR 27 billion in Central and Eastern Europe to finance projects fostering European integration , of which approximately 50 % has been invested in transport .
loans provided for investment projects in Slovakia run to more than EUR 1.@@ 67 billion since 1993 , of which almost one third ( EUR 515 million ) have been loans for the transport sector .
major projects co @-@ financed by the EIB in this field include the construction of Ko@@ si@@ cka Bridge over the Danube river in Bratislava , upgrading of track , rolling stock and telecommunications for national railways and the aforementioned Slovak Motorway and Express@@ way Programme .

European Investment Bank Group 2003
in 2003 , the European Investment Bank lent a total of EUR 4@@ 2.@@ 3@@ bn ( 2002 : 39.@@ 6@@ bn ) for projects furthering the European Union &apos;s political objectives .
financing in the EU Member States reached EUR 34.@@ 2@@ bn , while EUR 8.@@ 1@@ bn was made available in non @-@ EU countries .
lending in the future Member States of Central and Eastern Europe plus Cyprus and Malta ran to a record EUR 4.@@ 6@@ bn and in the Mediterranean Partner Countries ( including Turkey ) to EUR 2.@@ 1@@ b@@ n.
in the Western Balkan countries the Bank assisted reconstruction and development projects to the tune of EUR 372 million .
the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) the EIB Group &apos;s specialised venture capital arm took particip@@ ations worth EUR 135 million in venture capital funds and provided a total of EUR 2.@@ 2@@ bn in guarantees for SME financing .
to fund its lending the Bank launched 310 bond transactions on the international capital markets , raising an aggregate amount of EUR 4@@ 2@@ bn in 15 currencies .
outstanding lending amounted to EUR 207 bn and outstanding debt EUR 195 bn .
economic and social cohesion and regional development in an enlarged EU
top financing priority
promoting balanced regional development again featured as the top financing priority in 2003 .
within the EU @-@ 15 countries , EUR 16.@@ 3@@ bn was made available for projects in regional development areas in the form of individual loans and an estimated EUR 6.@@ 5@@ bn as credit lines ( &quot; global loans &quot; ) to partner banks ( for the financing of SME ventures and smaller @-@ scale public investment ) .
including the future Member States , regional development projects attracted EUR 27.@@ 3@@ bn in loans , corresponding to 70 % of the EIB &apos;s total lending in EU @-@ 15 and the future Member States in 2003 .
cooperation with the Commission was expanded .
the Bank is actively involved in project appraisal and information exchange on major projects for which ERDF , Cohesion Fund or ISPA Fund grants are sought .
in the future Member States ( including Bulgaria and Romania ) financing climbed to a record EUR 4.@@ 6@@ bn ( 2002 : 3.@@ 6@@ bn ) , consisting of 3.9@@ bn in individual loans and 660 million in global loans .
increasing attention was focused on protecting the environment including water resource management ( 16 % ) in order to meet EU environmental standards .
loans for environmental and transport schemes were in many cases supplemented by grants from the EU &apos;s ISPA Programme .
in the health and education sectors , where substantial infrastructural investment is also needed , lending was stepped up markedly ( 14 % ) .
some 19 % of loans were for investment in industry and the service sector , especially foreign direct investment , which contributes to the transfer of know @-@ how and capital into the region .
particularly noteworthy here was investment by motor vehicle manufacturers and suppliers in the Czech Republic and Hungary .
global loans to partner banks ( 14 % ) provided finance for SMEs and for investment by local and regional authorities .
all the new Member States will qualify as designated assisted areas .
a joint working group with the Commission &apos;s DG RE@@ GI@@ O is currently examining how best to coordinate the Bank &apos;s activity with the operations of the Structural Funds that will be available to the future Member States after accession and to blend EIB loans with European Commission grants .
internally , the Bank has adjusted its organisation so as to fully integrate the new members .
leading external source of finance for investment in future Member States
innovative and knowledge @-@ based European economy
through its &quot; Innovation 2010 Initiative &quot; the EIB supports various objectives : the EU strategy for an information and knowledge @-@ based economy adopted by the Lisbon European Council ( 2000 ) ; the target set by the Barcelona European Council ( 2002 ) of raising R &amp; D expenditure to 3 % of GNP ; and the European Action for Growth agreed in December 2003 .
having originally pledged support for the Union &apos;s Lisbon strategy of strengthening Europe &apos;s economic vigour and competitiveness for the period 2000 @-@ 2003 , the EIB in June 2003 extended its commitment as far as 2010 ( &quot; Innovation 2010 Initiative &quot; ) .
loans totalling EUR 6.@@ 2@@ bn were granted in 2003 under the Innovation 2010 Initiative ( 2002 : 3.@@ 6@@ bn ) .
at 1.4@@ bn , lending for the development of information and communications networks fell short of expectations for a revival of investment activity in this sector .
lending for R &amp; D investment , at 2.@@ 1@@ bn , remained at the previous year &apos;s level , while loans for educational infrastructure rose sharply to 2.7@@ bn ( 2002 : 900 million ) .
financing under the Innovation 2010 Initiative was channelled to both the EU &apos;s existing and future Member States .
particular emphasis was placed on projects in structurally weak regions in order to help bring the less @-@ developed regions into the knowledge @-@ based economic fold .
the Action for Growth aims at strengthening Europe &apos;s growth potential through increased investment in trans @-@ European transport , telecommunications and energy networks ( TENs ) , in innovation and in research and development including environmental technologies .
the intention is to mobilise private capital alongside public resources and EIB loans to finance such projects .
to this end , the EIB will offer innovative financing instruments ( guarantees , structured finance and loan securi@@ tisation ) .
in support of the Action for Growth , the EIB plans to lend up to EUR 40@@ bn ( including structured finance ) to back R &amp; D and innovation over the period to 2010 .
lending of up to EUR 20@@ bn is envisaged in the period to 2006 alone under &quot; Action for Growth , &quot; particularly for the &quot; Quick Start Programme &quot; and for projects in the future Member States .
European Action for Growth : strengthening Europe &apos;s growth potential through increased investment in TENs and R &amp; D &amp; Innovation
the European Investment Fund supports the Innovation 2010 Initiative by taking equity stakes in venture capital funds .
the EIF operates as a fund of funds , with a bias towards funds specialising in early @-@ stage financing and the hi @-@ tech sector .
it is now one of Europe &apos;s largest venture capital providers in this segment .
over 80 % of the resources it has invested to date have been provided by the EIB , with further capital coming from the Commission .
in 2003 , the EIF was for the first time commissioned by a third party to invest venture capital on its behalf : the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Employment is making available a EUR 250 million &quot; ERP Facility &quot; ( funded from the former European Recovery Programme ) .
the resources of this facility , supplemented by a further EUR 250 million from the EIB / EIF , will be invested exclusively in venture capital funds focusing on German high @-@ tech companies .
the EIF also assists the investment activity of SMEs indirectly by providing guarantees for the SME loan portfolios of financial institutions and public guarantee agencies .
this back @-@ up gives banks greater scope for lending to SMEs .
in 2003 the EIF concluded 30 guarantee operations totalling EUR 2.@@ 2@@ bn ( 2002 : 1.@@ 2@@ bn ) , bringing its guarantee portfolio to EUR 6.@@ 3@@ b@@ n.
over 250 000 SMEs have thereby indirectly benefited from EIF guarantees .
EIF : Europe &apos;s largest venture capital provider for early @-@ stage financing and the high @-@ tech sector
trans @-@ European and Access networks
in support of the Action for Growth and as part of a new TEN ( Trans @-@ European Network ) Investment Facility , the EIB plans to provide some EUR 50@@ bn in financing for TENs projects in the years 2004 @-@ 2010 .
up to EUR 25@@ bn of the total will be made available over the coming three years for transport TENs , particularly for schemes under the Quick Start Programme .
in special cases it will be possible for loans to be granted for up to 75 % of the investment costs and for periods of up to 35 years , with flexible repayment terms .
environmental protection
the Bank has set itself the target of devoting 30 @-@ 35 % of its total annual individual loans in the present and future Member States to environmental projects .
that level was comfortably exceeded in 2003 , with individual loans in the EU @-@ 15 and the future Member States reaching a record EUR 11.@@ 6@@ bn ( 2002 : 10.@@ 5@@ b@@ n. ) , or 42 % .
environmental projects financed encomp@@ assed schemes in the areas of local public transport , urban renewal , water and sanitation , waste disposal , energy saving and renewable energies .
in the environmental sector , the Bank and the European Commission are operational partners , combining their funds particularly in the future Member States , the Mediterranean countries and the ACP countries .
the Bank published its first environmental report at the beginning of 2003 and continued its dialogue with environmental organisations .
the Facility will be launched in 2004 .
the EIB might also contribute to the financing of the resulting projects .
the EIB might provide initially up to EUR 5 million with matching grants from other sources , such as the Commission and some Member States .
discussion of this proposal is still ongoing .
in support of climate change policies , the Bank had set itself the target of stepping up the proportion of energy project lending that it devotes to renewable energy sources from 7 to 15 % .
this should help to increase the cost @-@ effectiveness of renewable energy and facilitate bank financing of such projects .
EIB and European Commission as operational partners
EIB initiatives for contributing to sustainable development
support for EU development and cooperation policies
in December 2003 the European Council also decided to enhance FEMIP , in view of the favourable results achieved since the Facility &apos;s creation in October 2002 .
a further review will be carried out in December 2006 , in the light of experience gained and after consultation with the Mediterranean partners in the Barcelona process , to consider the case for setting up a &quot; Mediterranean Bank &quot; with the EIB as majority shareholder .
FEMIP enhancement involves :
creating a special facility for higher @-@ risk financing intended to promote investment in the private sector ;
establishing , with voluntarily contributed development aid resources and risk capital from EU and other countries , a &quot; Trust Fund &quot; to finance technical assistance and provide grants for priority infrastructure projects ;
in the past year the Bank has created the necessary organisation to enable it successfully to carry out its FEMIP activities and perform its growing role as a development bank with an expanded technical assistance input .
this includes the opening of local representative offices - in Cairo already and in the Maghreb shortly .
the Cotonou ACP @-@ EU Partnership Agreement entered into force in April 2003 , replacing the Lomé IV Convention .
the Member States have mandated the EIB to manage , over the next five years , a EUR 2.@@ 2@@ bn Investment Facility to finance projects in the ACP countries .
in addition , the EIB will make loans of up to EUR 1.7@@ bn available over five years from its own resources .
the main focus is on poverty alleviation .
priority is being given to smaller @-@ scale investment in the private sector and to education and healthcare schemes .
because of the developmental tasks , activity in the ACP States has also been brought together in a single operational unit .

borrowing activities in 2003
the Bank strengthened its position as the largest and leading supranational bond issuer .
the volume of borrowing increased by 11 % to EUR 42 bn , raised through 310 transactions in 15 currencies .
the Bank &apos;s three core currencies ( EUR , GBP , USD ) accounted for 88 % of funding .
issuance in 12 additional currencies ( 12 % of funding ) involved the currencies of Acceding Countries ( CZK , HUF , PLN , SK@@ K ) , other European countries ( CHF , SEK , NOK ) , Asia @-@ Pacific / Japan ( AUD , HK@@ D , JP@@ Y , NT@@ D ) and Africa ( Z@@ AR ) .
this underlines the continued strength of diversification in the EIB &apos;s funding activities .
the EIB has garn@@ ered several awards for its funding performance in 2003 .
largest and leading supranational bond issuer
in EUR , where the Bank raised EUR 17@@ bn , there was especially strong growth in structured issuance in the form of inflation @-@ linked and call@@ able bonds .
the total volume of EUR benchmarks outstanding and traded on Euro@@ M@@ TS , a leading electronic trading platform for sovereign@@ s and agencies , increased to 11 issues worth around EUR 60@@ bn .
in USD , the Bank raised over USD 13@@ bn and the main area of growth was structured issuance .
sterling issuance reached close to GBP 5@@ bn .
this growth in local currency borrowing has supported continued lending growth and the EIB &apos;s position as the largest external lender in the region .
borrowing highlights included increased placements of innovative structured products and exceptionally long mat@@ urities ( notably in CZK and SK@@ K ) .
penetration of key markets
issuance in EU @-@ Acceding country currencies more than doubled

the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term financing institution , is making available to SP@@ GE ( Société Publi@@ que de Ges@@ tion de l &apos;E@@ au ) a long @-@ term loan of EUR 200 million for investment in public sanitation , protection of water cat@@ chment areas and priority drainage works .
MAR@@ COURT , Walloon Minister for the Economy and Employment and Beno@@ ît Lut@@ gen , Walloon Minister for Agriculture , Rural Affairs , the Environment and Tourism .
SP@@ GE is a public @-@ law company created in 1999 .
to that end , SP@@ GE has drawn up a EUR 2 billion 10 @-@ year programme .
the first EIB loan tranche ( EUR 100 million ) will help to fund part of SP@@ GE &apos;s investment programme .
the investment programme will have a highly beneficial impact on the environment of the Walloon Region , with a direct effect not only on the cities of Liège , Charleroi and Nam@@ ur but also on the whole of the Sam@@ bre @-@ Me@@ use and Schel@@ dt basins and beyond , extending to their conf@@ lu@@ ences and ultimately the North Sea .
speaking at the loan signing ceremony , Philippe Maystadt commented :
&quot; since the 1980s , the water and sanitation sector has been a key area for EIB financing , thereby helping the Member States to comply with the Union &apos;s environmental directives .
the EIB supports projects geared to the integrated and sustainable management of resources . &quot;
additionally , through the global loans instrument , the EIB finances smaller @-@ scale schemes carried out by local authorities , particularly in the field of water distribution and wastewater treatment .
this first operation in Wallonia with SP@@ GE plus the other loans already concluded with the Flemish water treatment company Aqu@@ afin brings the EIB &apos;s support for this sector in Belgium to EUR 8@@ 27 million .

FEMIP provides EUR 340 million for transport in the Mediterranean
loans totalling EUR 340 million have just been signed under the Facility for Euro @-@ Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) for transport in the Mediterranean region .
today more than ever , the countries of the Mediterranean are the Union &apos;s new neighbours .
the three loans granted are for the following projects :
they will enable Egyp@@ t@@ Air to tailor capacity to its customers &quot;
EUR 40 million for upgrading the urban road network of Greater Tunis and the govern@@ or@@ ates of Mon@@ asti@@ r and Mé@@ den@@ ine in Tunisia .
it complements the road schemes already financed by the Bank since 1994 ( to the tune of EUR 246 million ) , which focused on improvement and extension programmes on priority roads in Greater Tunis , in the main towns of the country &apos;s road network .
the African Development Bank is co @-@ financing this project .
background information
FEMIP aims to help the MP@@ Cs in meeting the challenges of economic and social modernisation and enhanced regional integration , in line with the Wider Europe Neighbourhood Policy and in preparation for the establishment of a Euro @-@ Mediterranean free trade area .
it enables Europe to step up its cooperation with the partner countries .
thanks to this Facility , with its increased financial resources , the EIB has been able progressively to expand its lending in the region from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 billion annually .
it focuses on foreign direct investment and local private sector initiatives as well as social sector projects , particularly in the fields of health , education and environmental protection , with the aim of fostering social stability and productive investment .

the EIB &apos;s inaugural meeting of FEMIP &apos;s Committee of Experts held in Marseille
set up to operate as a think tank , this Committee is charged with the task of putting forward practical and operational recommendations to FEMIP &apos;s Ministerial Committee , made up of the Economics and Finance Ministers of the EU and the MP@@ Cs .
the Committee of Experts was welcomed to Marseille by Mayor Jean @-@ Claude G@@ audi@@ n and the meeting was closed by Mr Ren@@ aud Muse@@ lier , Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs .
it is the prospect of equitable and sustainable development for all the inhabitants of the Mediterranean region that motiv@@ ates the City of Marseille &apos;s international initiatives .
the Facility for Euro @-@ Mediterranean Investment and Partnership is a key tool in this regard .
it is up to you to bring it to life and make it as effective as possible in preparation for the planned creation of a free @-@ trade zone in 2010 . &quot;
Mr Philippe de Fontaine Vive , for his part , commented : &quot;
back in April 2003 , Marseille played host to the EIB in connection with a seminar on sustainable investment in the Mediterranean .
at that time FEMIP was equipping itself for its role and that meeting helped to chart its priorities and ambitions : namely to foster development of the private sector and foreign direct investment in the partner countries , in preparation for the Euro @-@ Mediterranean customs union in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; not only has FEMIP achieved its objectives , &quot; continued Mr Philippe de Fontaine Vive ,
in this spirit , the enhanced FEMIP represents a key instrument for close cooperation among all the partners concerned .
it is supporting the institutional reforms that are the responsibility of each of the partner countries .
this initiative is being mounted in concert with those of the other principal fun@@ ders , and I am confident that a strategic partnership agreement between the EIB , the World Bank Group and the Commission to strengthen our cooperation will be concluded in the near future . &quot;
concentrating on the two themes of privatisation and private companies &apos; access to the various sources of finance , the 70 experts from the Mediterranean region came up with the following conclusions :
access by private companies to the various sources of finance : efforts must focus on three broad areas :
the banking sector : reforming the banking sector so as to achieve greater concentration and exposure to international competition ; improving service quality ; training staff , particularly in credit risk analysis and the use of non @-@ personal security .
companies : improving the transparency of accounts and developing partnership with other investors .
financial products : developing new products ( leasing , risk capital , financial services ) and new structures ( investment funds , development capital companies , investment banks , guarantee funds ) .
in his closing address , Mr Philippe de Fontaine Vive noted that : &quot;

EUR 250 million EIB support for the private sector in Turkey
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term lending institution , is providing a loan of EUR 250 million in support of the private sector in Turkey .
the EIB funds , in the form of global loans , will be chann@@ eled through five Turkish partner banks , to small and medium @-@ sized private sector projects in the areas of industry , services and tourism .
the five partner banks include the EIB &apos;s two long standing partners - Industrial Development Bank of Turkey ( T@@ SK@@ B ) and Tur@@ ki@@ ye V@@ ak@@ if@@ lar Bank@@ asi ( V@@ ak@@ if@@ bank ) as well as three &quot; new &quot; partner banks : the Development Bank of Turkey ( T@@ KB ) , Tur@@ ki@@ ye Hal@@ k Bank@@ asi and TC Zi@@ ra@@ at Bank@@ asi .
the EIB , through this global loan , remains committed to supporting the banking sector &apos;s long @-@ term lending activities and , with a broadened base of partner banks , now hopes to have even greater reach to the SME sector throughout the country .
the &quot; new &quot; partner banks will also be supported by a long @-@ term technical assistance contract , designed to reinforce and strengthen their long @-@ term project lending capabilities .
this technical assistance represents the EIB &apos;s first allocation to Turkey of grant financing from the EIB @-@ EU Commission &apos;s recently established FEMIP Technical Assistance Fund .
with the new Facility for Euro @-@ Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) , the EIB has reinforced its cooperation with the Mediterranean Partner Countries ( MPC ) .
endowed with increased financial resources , FEMIP will enable the EIB gradually to scale up its annual lending activity in the region from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 billion .
FEMIP accords priority to financing private @-@ sector projects with the dual aim of liberalising the MPC economies and expanding their potential in the run @-@ up to the EU @-@ MPC Customs Union in 2010 .
in this connection , the EIB &apos;s objective is to bolster the proportion of financing it devotes to private @-@ sector projects to 33 % .
it places emphasis on FDI and private sector activity , as well as on social @-@ sector projects , particularly health , education and environmental protection , in the belief that this will make for social stability and encourage productive investment .
EIB finance for infrastructure went mainly for environmental projects and the 1999 earthquake reconstruction effort .
among the projects financed in Turkey are : the wastewater and eff@@ lu@@ ent treatment systems in Bur@@ sa , A@@ dana , Mer@@ sin , Di@@ y@@ arb@@ ak@@ ir , Iz@@ mit and Tar@@ sus ; the Urban Development Project for the city of Esk@@ ise@@ hir , the des@@ ul@@ ph@@ ur@@ isation equipment at the Y@@ eni@@ kö@@ y power station on the Aegean coast and the construction of more environment @-@ friendly power and heating plants .
the EIB has also promoted SMEs through several global loans to local commercial banks .

this confirms the position of the EU &apos;s financing institution as a major player in promoting the region &apos;s economic development and stability .
focus on private sector and private @-@ sector enabling infrastructure
lending also placed emphasis on infrastructure projects , including energy , human capital and environment , underpinning private sector development in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt , Lebanon and Syria .
other EIB @-@ financed projects included :
power and water supply and distribution in Egypt , Morocco and Tunisia ;
improvement of health infrastructure in Syria and Tunisia ;
re@@ modelling of education systems in Jordan and Turkey ;

the purpose of the credit line in favour of the Municipality of Genoa , the Province of Genoa , the Liguria Region and Banca Cari@@ ge is to finance public infrastructure and private @-@ sector investment in the Province of Genoa .
the funding has been agreed for development of the city and province of Genoa .
it is particularly directed at urban regeneration and roads projects as well as health , educational and environmental schemes .
the EIB loan will be divided between the Municipality of Genoa ( EUR 150 million ) , the Province of Genoa ( EUR 30 million ) , the Liguria Region ( EUR 50 million ) and Banca Cari@@ ge ( EUR 120 million ) .
it will help fund investments worth some EUR 850 million in total .
the projects to be considered form part of the development plans of the Municipality and Province of Genoa and the Liguria Region .
Banca Cari@@ ge will receive direct funding to support schemes by private enterprises and local authorities .
Banca Cari@@ ge has worked in cooperation with the EIB for some ten years and last December benefited from a maiden loan for the Genoa area .
this operation , carried out with the collaboration of FIL@@ SE ( the Liguria Region &apos;s financing company ) , is the Bank &apos;s first in favour of the various strata of local government and the banking sector .
the innovative capital structure was adopted to make available to all interested players the resources required to implement consistent , integrated operations .
support for the public sector is complemented by that for private enterprise , through the intermediary of the banking sector .
this structure brings together two major European objectives : subsidiarity and public @-@ private partnership .
subsidiarity emphasises the close connection between where decisions are taken and where they are implemented .
public @-@ private partnerships are an efficient instrument when resources are scarce and there are urgent and substantial needs .
on this basis , the EIB is contributing to the modernisation and rehabilitation process in the Genoa area , with a view to further operations as part of its Operational Programme and under the Action for Growth adopted by the European Council .

the EIB inaugur@@ ates in Morocco the first of a series of conferences on promoting private sector development in the Mediterranean Partner Countries
the patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI bore witness to the significance of the event for Morocco .
the conference has been organised in close cooperation with the Conf@@ é@@ dé@@ ration Générale des Entre@@ prises du Maro@@ c ( CG@@ EM ) and through the efforts of its President , Mr Hassan Cham@@ i .
these highly specific measures are intended to help prepare Moroccan businesses to meet international competition in the run @-@ up to the creation of a free trade area between Europe and the partner countries in 2010 .
Mr Chor@@ fi , Director of the Moroccan Treasury , explained the current and forthcoming reforms and the prospects for a growth @-@ targeted policy .
the politically strained situation in the region renders it more than ever necessary to nurture Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership and economic development in the region .
in this context , the enhanced FEMIP represents a key instrument for achieving close cooperation among the partners concerned .
it also aims at stepping up long @-@ term lending and developing new products and technical assistance .
for 2004 , FEMIP is lining up financing operations totalling some EUR 2 billion .
more than 200 prominent figures from the worlds of government , business and banking participated in this inaugural EIB Conference dedicated to the financing of SMEs in the Mediterranean , an event which Mr Philippe de Fontaine Vive indicated would be paralleled by similar ones both within the Union and in the other Partner Countries .
background information
the breakdown of FEMIP &apos;s operations since its creation clearly reflects its top priority , with more than one third of its operations aimed at directly promoting the growth of private businesses , whether through foreign direct investment , joint ventures arising from cooperation between MPC promoters or financing for SMEs .
at the same time , FEMIP has placed emphasis on schemes relating to infrastructure , water , the upgrading of healthcare facilities and the re@@ modelling of education systems .
finally , FEMIP has furnished assistance for populations stricken by natural disasters .
FEMIP represents a major turning point in financial and economic cooperation between the Union and the MP@@ Cs .
its operational priorities are :
increased involvement of the region &apos;s countries through an annual meeting of the Ministerial Committee and through the opening of regional offices in the Mas@@ hre@@ q and Maghreb ;
priority focus on private sector development as a generator of wealth and jobs ;
promoting investment in human capital ;
greater technical assistance for the design of quality projects and the economic reform process in the MP@@ Cs ;
providing innovative financial products and risk capital ;
increasing the annual volume of financing to EUR 2 billion .

remuneration for the quasi @-@ equity funds so provided is geared to the profitability of the enterprise itself or to other indicators of its activity
Poland : EIB Provi@@ des Global Lo@@ an of EUR 100 Million for small and medium sized investments
the European Investment Bank provides a EUR 100 million Global Lo@@ an to PK@@ O Bank Pol@@ ski to finance projects of small and medium @-@ scale enterprises and municipalities in Poland .
EIB Global Lo@@ ans have been developed as a successful tool in providing long @-@ term EIB funds for financing smaller projects implemented by the SME sector or by municipalities under favourable conditions .
the Global Lo@@ ans represent special credit lines to selected partner banks operating in the individual countries .
this financial scheme is used by the EIB to finance small and medium @-@ size projects with a total investment higher than EUR 40 000 and less than EUR 25 million .
EIB partner banks assess each project , assume the credit risk and set the loan conditions for the final beneficiary .
interested investors should address their partner bank directly .
Mr. Thomas H@@ ACK@@ ETT , Deputy Director General , who signed the loan stated : &quot;
the EIB is pleased to sign its first global loan with PK@@ O Bank Pol@@ ski , the largest bank in Poland .
in line with EU priorities we support financing of the SME sector which plays a very significant role in creating jobs and developing the economy , particularly so in the less @-@ developed areas of Poland . &quot;
background
the EIB , as the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term financing institution , has provided more than EUR 7.4 billion for projects in Poland since 1990 .
the major share of the EIB loans was directed to the infrastructure sector ( approximately 55 % of the total lending in the country representing EUR 4.1 billion ) , followed environment and water sectors ( EUR 1.5 billion ) and the above @-@ mentioned global loans .
generally , in the New Member States of Central Europe , the EIB has lent more than EUR 25 billion to projects since 1990 .
therefore , the EIB is the most important external source of finance for Central and Eastern Europe .

leading donors agree on joint efforts towards better coordination of activities in the Middle East and North Africa / Mediterranean region
the European Commission , the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) and the World Bank today signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding aimed at enhancing donor coordination in the Middle East and North Africa / Southern Mediterranean region .
the agreement signed in Brussels by senior officials from the three institutions will lead to a more focused and complementary approach at all levels from programme implementation to aid programming and overall policies .
despite the region &apos;s rich cultural history and heritage , its vast wealth of natural resources and its undoub@@ ted development potential , it is nonetheless bes@@ et by many challenges and a vast prosperity gap between countries North and South of the Mediterranean .
the growth performance of most countries has proved to be insufficient to tackle poverty and unemployment .
almost 100 million new jobs need to be created in the coming two decades to guarantee employment for today &apos;s unemployed workers , and future , first @-@ time job @-@ seekers .
the EU &apos;s Barcelona Process and Neighbourhood policy , the EIB &apos;s Facility for Euro @-@ Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) and the World Bank &apos;s regional strategy testify to their commitment and engagement .
an aggregated approach would avoid duplication and competition of efforts while facilitating focus on the respective strengths of the partners .
the objective of the Memorandum of Understanding is to further enhance , structure and streamline the coordination process .
the principal beneficiaries of such an agreed and coordinated approach at regional , country and sectoral levels would be the countries of the region , who in the past may have suffered the adverse side @-@ effects of donor fragmentation .
a coordinated approach starting on a pragmatic basis and linking EC grant assistance operations , EIB project financing and World Bank loans and technical capacity will enhance the efficiency of each partner &apos;s efforts in responding to the region &apos;s needs .
the European Commission already has similar Memor@@ anda of Understanding with leading donors in the new Member States / candidate countries and in the New Independent States .

while in 2000 the annual lending was EUR 240 million , it had increased in 2003 to EUR 7@@ 41 million .
to date , EIB loans in Hungary have financed projects in infrastructure ( 46 % ) , followed by global loans supporting investments of SMEs and municipalities ( 27 % ) , investments in industry ( 10 % ) , water and environment sectors ( 10 % ) and energy ( 7 % ) .

these loans will contribute to further economic progress and be instrumental in deepening the integration of Hungary within the European Union .
description of the individual loans :
EUR 4@@ 45 million loan to co @-@ finance projects funded by EU grants
the EIB provides to the Republic of Hungary a loan of EUR 4@@ 45 million to assist in the implementation of projects that will be supported by the EU Structural Funds .
the loan will finance projects in most of the priorities identified by the Hungarian authorities for EU Structural Funds financing .
as EIB funds will normally be available prior to EU grants financing , they should help accelerate the implementation of projects already selected and the finalisation of those under preparation .
this in turn will also help to step up local absorption of EU assistance under the Structural Funds .
the loan will help finance the national contribution of Hungary to EU Structural Funds .
the remaining EUR 700 million will be provided by the state budget ( which is supported by the current facility ) and the own contributions of local municipalities and SMEs .
the projects financed by the loan will contribute to the further enhancement of Hungary &apos;s social and economic convergence within the EU .
the projects will be promoted under the aegis of the National Development Office by various ministries such as the Ministries of Environment &amp; Water , of Economy &amp; Transport , of Employment and Labour , Office of Regional Development , Regional Development Agencies and several other Inter@@ mediate Bo@@ dies involved in implementation of the Community Support Framework .
public institutions , local governments and SMEs will be the final beneficiaries of the loan .
EIB loan of EUR 35 million for Budapest Education infrastructure and services investments
the EIB loan of EUR 35 million helps the Municipality of Budapest in financing investments in educational infrastructure and services in an amount of close to EUR 50 million .
the loan will cover school renovations , improvement of energy saving measures of education facilities and development of education related information and communication networks including corresponding hardware and software .
fifty @-@ six schools and education facilities will benefit from this loan .
this facility is the first tranche of a EUR 75 million financial envelope by EIB which will support some EUR 100 million of planned investments by the City of Budapest for education purposes in the next few years .
loan of EUR 125 million for E.ON Hung@@ á@@ ria &apos;s investments
the project is focused on refurbishment of the electricity transmission and distribution networks owned and operated by E.ON Hung@@ á@@ ria , R@@ t. through its three regional distribution subsidiaries Dé@@ d@@ á@@ sz , É@@ d@@ á@@ sz and Tit@@ á@@ sz .
new Global Lo@@ an Facilities to support lending to municipalities

the agreements including the recently established Municipal Infrastructure Facility and Municipal Finance Facility under global loan operations were signed with Central @-@ European International Bank Ltd . , Erste Bank Hungary R@@ t. , Raiff@@ eisen Bank R@@ t. and Mag@@ yar@@ or@@ sz@@ á@@ gi Volks@@ bank R@@ t ..
a new global loan of EUR 50 million was provided to Raiff@@ eisen Bank R@@ t. at the same time .
the mentioned banks are the first EIB &apos;s partner banks benefiting from the above mentioned municipal facilities .
the Municipal Infrastructure Facility is focused on investments of municipalities in the area of environment , transport , health and education in the Ny@@ ug@@ at Dun@@ ant@@ úl border region .
the Municipal Finance Facility promotes building , upgrading or refurbis@@ hing of small municipal infrastructure in the entire territory of Hungary .
EIB Global Lo@@ ans have been developed as a successful tool in providing long @-@ term EIB funds for financing smaller projects implemented by the SME sector or by municipalities under favourable conditions .
they represent credit lines to financial intermediaries EIB partner banks - that on @-@ lend EIB funds under their own management , at their own risk and own conditions but which should reflect the favourable lending condition of the EIB .
since 1990 , the EIB has lent a total of EUR 26 billion in Central and Eastern Europe to finance projects fostering European integration , approx .
EUR 3.5 billion of this figure being provided through Global Lo@@ ans .
during the mentioned period the EIB has signed global loan facilities for a combined amount of approximately EUR 1 billion with 9 partner banks operating in Hungary .

together with some 130 representatives from public and local authorities and the banking sector they discussed the investment needs of Hungarian municipalities and SMEs and ways and means to maximise the benefit of loans and grants provided by Hungary &apos;s EU membership .
Wolfgang Roth pointed to the important investment needs and the roles of the national authorities , European Commission , EIB and the local banks in meeting these .
Wolfgang Roth said he was particularly pleased about the close cooperation between the EIB and the Commission in using the pre @-@ accession instruments , in particular ISPA , that established a good basis for the successful implementation of projects under the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds in the coming years .
János Ver@@ es added that EU grants available between 2004 to 2006 represent about 2.0 to 2.5 per cent of GDP , and this can be expected to double from 2007 .
these grants can generate a multiplier effect supporting the growth potential for the national economy as a whole .
it is of high importance therefore that potential beneficiaries of Community grants have access to financial facilities to ensure the required internal funds .
EIB loan facilities can also help in this area .
he confirmed that the government funds for co @-@ financing EU grant supported municipal projects have already been set aside in the budget .
they also expressed interest in new lending opportunities in these segments .
EIB has provided some EUR 1 billion in credit lines ( &quot; global loans &quot; ) to nine Hungarian partner banks to date for the financing mainly of SME and municipal investments .
new Global Lo@@ ans of some EUR 300 million are expected to be signed this year in line with growing investment activity .
given the success of this forum , grouping the main actors in this field , the sponsors agreed to consider a follow @-@ up seminar on specific themes for a future date in Hungary .
speakers contributions and full programme are available under

this makes the project a further example of the excellent cooperation , which exists between EIB , the E@@ AR and the EBRD in the Balkan region .
the EIB is progressively increasing its long @-@ term lending in the Balkan countries .
these investments will complement the traditional financial support given to upgrade and reconstruct infrastructure .

enhanced role for FEMIP Ministerial Meeting in Alexandria
FEMIP &apos;s first new supervisory Ministerial Meeting welcomes results achieved in private sector development under the strengthened financial partnership and prepares future action .
the Ministerial Committee Meeting of the Facility for Euro @-@ Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) took place at the Biblioth@@ eca Alexand@@ rina , in Alexandria on 7 June .
this was the first Meeting to be held in its enhanced role , through which it is set to become the Mediterranean &quot; Ecofin Council . &quot;
being also the first one after EU enlargement , it was attended by the representatives of 25 EU Member States .
the discussion was based on practical and operational recommendations concerning the two subjects of privatisation and private companies &quot; access to the various sources of finance , prepared and put forward by the first FEMIP Experts Committee Meeting held in Marseille on 16 @-@ 17 February 2004 .
the Ministerial Committee Meeting also discussed policy issues
concerning the creation of the FEMIP Trust Fund ( FT@@ F ) and greeted progress on the FEMIP Technical Assistance ( TA ) Support Fund with a forecast of EUR 5@@ 4.7 million of commitments in 2003 @-@ 2004 in environment , human capital ,
infrastructure , as well as industry and finance .
FEMIP &apos;s Ministerial Committee Meeting reaffirmed the strong commitment of the 35 European and Mediterranean Finance and Economy Ministers to forge a closer economic partnership and greeted with satisfaction the first concrete results of FEMIP &apos;s activity for private sector development in the MP@@ Cs , examining in particular the example of Tunisia .
the participants also expressed satisfaction on the new format of dialogue between the MP@@ Cs and European representatives , notably extended through the Experts Committee .
Mr Philippe de Fontaine Vive , in his opening address stated : &quot;
to this end FEMIP will assist quantit@@ atively with a EUR 2 bil@@ lli@@ on annual lending volume , but also qualit@@ atively with new lending instruments and techniques , particularly in support of privatisation programmes in the Mediterranean Partner Countries , including larger privatisation of public services and utilities .
the FEMIP &quot; menu of options for privatisation &quot; available to the MP@@ Cs , ranges from setting a framework agreement with the local authority concerned , assistance to the privatisation programme through the FEMIP Support Fund ( grants ) , provision of equity or quasi equity finance to the provision of loans and other finance to new investments after privatisation . &quot;
FEMIP is confident that such agreements will be followed by increased cooperation with other international and European bilateral institutions active in the Region .
with some EUR 2.1 billion total lending in the MP@@ Cs in 2003 , the first operational year since its launch , FEMIP is the leading player in fostering sustainable development in the region .
most notably , about half this amount went to finance private sector projects through Foreign Direct Investment ( Egypt ,
Tunisia , and Turkey ) , joint ventures resulting from cooperation between MPC promoters ( Algeria ) and Small Medium @-@ Sized Enterprises ( SME ) financing ( Syria , Tunisia , Turkey , and creation of a regional venture capital fund ) .
the latter has been signed by Mr Ham@@ ou@@ da Ham@@ di , Tunisian Secretary of State for International Cooperation as well as Foreign Investment , and Mr. Ph@@ . de Fontaine Vive , EIB Vice @-@ President , with special responsibility for FEMIP .
the project consists of 9 schemes in the Greater Tunis area , and 4 schemes in the main cities of Mon@@ asti@@ r , S@@ fax and S@@ ousse .
in Tunisia , the Bank has been providing ongoing support for investment in urban road networks totalling more than EUR 180 million , principally in Tunis but also in other major urban centres of the country .
the next Ministerial Committee will take place in Morocco during Spring 2005 and will be prepared by two Experts Committee Meetings to be held in Amsterdam in October 2004 and in Luxembourg in March 2005 .

the quick conclusion of this second contract shows our closer co @-@ operation with the EIB which has been enhanced by its local representation in East Africa . &quot;
through increasing the volume and reli@@ abli@@ lity of electric energy supply to households and businesses in Kenya at cost effective prices and the use of an indigenous source of energy , the two projects supported by the EIB will promote socio @-@ economic development in the country on a sustainable basis .
the population in Kenya stands to benefit from improved distribution quality and wider ac@@ ess to power supply as well as from the growth of economic activities fostered by the enhanced supply of electricity .
in order to help maintaining the sustainability of Kenya &apos;s external debt , the funds for K@@ PLC &apos;s grid development will be released to the Government at a reduced interest rate resulting in a grant element of 35 % ,
based on subsidies made available from resources of the European Development Fund .

total lending increased by 2.1 % to EUR 4@@ 3.2 billion , of which 92 % within the EU @-@ 25 .
to finance its lending , the Bank raised EUR 50 billion on the international capital markets ( 2003 : EUR 42 billion ) .
for details see :
focus on EU priorities
the EIB &apos;s support for economic and social cohesion within the European Union remained the core lending objective .
support for the European Action for Growth was maintained .
lending for research , development and innovation tot@@ alled EUR 7 billion .
to further the EU &apos;s development and cooperation policy in Partner Countries , the Bank reinforced its presence in the southern and eastern Mediterranean , providing EUR 2.2 billion in loans .
the Bank also established an EUR 30 million Trust Fund and set up a Special FEMIP En@@ velop@@ e for risk @-@ sharing operations .
Cairo ) , and three in the ACP countries ( Dakar , Nairobi and Pretoria ) .
in Europe the Bank continued its support for the development of the Acceding Countries ( Bulgaria and Romania ) and the Candidate Countries ( Croatia and Turkey ) .
the EIB will soon start to lend EUR 500 million under the new mandate for Russia , Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova .
President Maystadt drew attention to the progress made in consolidating corporate governance principles based on transparency and accountability , in accordance with best international practice .
for example :
management Committee members now have to sign a declaration of financial interest ;
conflicts of interest reported by members of the Board of Directors are disclosed publicly ;
a Compliance Office has been created ;
a statement on corporate and social responsibility has been published .
innovation and quality
the EIB &apos;s watch@@ words are innovation and quality .
innovation is to be sought through new forms of collaboration with the banking sector , in new financial instruments , and new ways of serving small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
quality means further increasing the EIB &apos;s value added , on the basis of three criteria : the specific contributions of a project to EU policy objectives ;
the quality and sound@@ ness of projects ; and the particular financial advantage for the user of EIB funds .
innovation and greater value added will lead to a gradual increase in risk .
the trend towards a higher risk profile ,
by taking on greater risk if and when justified , the EIB will aim to be a path@@ finder in the financing of projects implementing EU policies .
in the Partner Countries outside the EU , the EIB will focus on increasing the developmental impact of the investment being financed .
the EIB envisages greater cooperation with all concerned in this field .

activity of the EIB Group in 2004
in 2004 , the European Investment Bank lent a total of EUR 4@@ 3.@@ 2@@ bn ( 2003 : 4@@ 2.@@ 3@@ bn ) for projects furthering the European Union &apos;s political objectives .
lending in support of EU development policy tot@@ alled EUR 2.9@@ b@@ n.
to fund its lending , the EIB raised an aggregate amount of EUR 50@@ bn on the international capital markets through 282 bond issues in 15 currencies .
economic and social cohesion in the enlarged EU ( EUR 28.@@ 5@@ bn )
fostering the EU &apos;s cohesion by contributing to the reduction of imbalances between regions is the EIB &apos;s prime task and its first operational priority .
with the Union &apos;s eastward enlargement , this priority has become even more important since all of the new Member States qualify as designated assisted areas .
within the EU @-@ 25 countries , individual loans ( loans for individual projects app@@ raised by the Bank ) worth EUR 21.@@ 5@@ bn were granted in 2004 for investment contributing to the strengthening of the economic potential of assisted areas .
a further EUR 7@@ bn was made available as credit lines ( global loans ) to partner banks for the financing of SME ventures and smaller @-@ scale public investment .
the total lending of EUR 28.@@ 5@@ bn for regional development represents some 72 % of the EIB &apos;s aggregate lending within the EU @-@ 25 .
the main sectors of lending in regional development areas were transport and telecommunications infrastructure ( accounting for 39 % of the individual loans granted ) , investment in industry and the services sector ( 20 % ) , urban infrastructure ( 14 % ) and health and education infrastructure ( 11 % ) .
in the new Member States the EIB continued its efforts to support foreign direct investment , as this contributes to the transfer of both know @-@ how and capital into the region and , therefore , to the modernisation and restructuring of industry .
innovative and knowledge @-@ based European economy ( EUR 7@@ bn )
through its &quot; Innovation 2010 Initiative &quot; ( &quot; i@@ 2i &quot; ) , the EIB supports the EU &apos;s Lisbon Strategy for an information and knowledge @-@ based economy .
this package includes lending for the Quick Start Programme of the innovation part of the European Action for Growth .
so far the EIB has lived up to its commitments under i@@ 2i .
by the end of 2004 , total loans approved since the start of i@@ 2i in 2000 amounted to EUR 34.@@ 4@@ bn , and loan contracts actually signed stood at EUR 24.@@ 1@@ b@@ n.
lending under i@@ 2i since 2000 has been divided between the three key fields :
RD and downstream investment ( 42 % ) ; education and training for furthering employability ( 29 % ) ; and ICT ( 29 % ) .
projects have been distributed throughout the EU @-@ 25 .
some 80 % of the total lending has been in the private sector .
with a full &quot; i@@ 2i &quot; pipeline at present , the EIB is set to meet its objective of mobilising EUR 50@@ bn in support of the Lisbon Strategy by 2010 .
the EIB has therefore gradually reinforced its capacity to grant loans that entail a higher lending risk by increasing the provi@@ sioning reserve for its Struc@@ tured Finance Facility ( SF@@ F ) .
loans under the SF@@ F will be made available more widely for higher @-@ than @-@ usual risk operations in the field of RD and innovation .
the EIB has also taken the initiative to make better provision for the specific financing needs of medium sized @-@ enterprises ( mid @-@ caps , i.e. businesses with more than 250 but less than 3 000 employees ) , particularly for financing RD .
efforts are currently being made to further develop new financial instruments that combine loans and grants ( typically from the EU , but also from national budgets ) and will therefore enable more resources to be mobilised for RD and innovation .
the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) supports the Innovation 2010 Initiative by taking equity stakes in venture capital funds .
represented a good range of operations in Italy , Spain , France , the UK and Germany , as well as some operations in the new Member States .
it is now one of Europe &apos;s largest venture capital providers in this segment .
recently , the EIF has broadened its investment policy to include also mid and later @-@ stage funds .
the presence of private investors remains fragmented , mainly because of the uncertain economic situation and strong risk aversion .
in such difficult times the EIF &apos;s presence in the market is all the more important as a stable source of funds and thus in helping to attract private sector funding .
the EIF further assists the investment activity of SMEs indirectly by providing guarantees for the SME loan portfolios of financial institutions and public guarantee agencies .
in 2004 , the EIF provided a total of EUR 1.4@@ bn in guarantees for SME portfolios , bringing its guarantee portfolio to EUR 7.@@ 7@@ b@@ n.
these guarantees facilitate the securi@@ tisation of such portfolios or reduce regulatory capital allocation to such assets , which gives banks greater scope for lending to SMEs .
trans @-@ European Networks ( EUR 7.@@ 9@@ bn )
efficient transport , energy and information networks are vital for the economic integration of the enlarged EU .
in response to the successive EU initiatives identifying Trans @-@ European Networks ( TENs ) in the EU @-@ 25 and the remaining Accession States , the EIB has scaled up its lending in support of TENs , after having already been heavily involved in financing TENs over the last 10 years .
up to EUR 25@@ bn will be made available in the period 2004 @-@ 2006 for transport TENs , particularly for projects under the Q@@ SP .
in 2004 , signed loans in support of TEN projects within the enlarged EU tot@@ alled EUR 7.@@ 9@@ bn , of which EUR 6.@@ 6@@ bn for transport and EUR 1.@@ 3@@ bn for energy projects .
environmental protection ( EUR 10.@@ 9@@ bn )
in 2004 , the EIB signed individual loans for environmental projects totalling EUR 10.@@ 9@@ bn , of which EUR 10.@@ 4@@ bn in the EU @-@ 25 ( EUR 9.@@ 8@@ bn in the EU @-@ 15 ) .
most of the lending was directed to the urban environment ( EUR 6@@ bn ) , i.e. urban transport and urban renewal .
the EIB has attached greater importance to renewable energy .
at the International Conference for Renewable Energy in Bonn ( 2004 ) , the EIB pledged to increase renewable energy &apos;s share of total new electricity generation capacity financed by the Bank in the EU from some 15 % at present to 50 % by 2010 , including a greater share for non @-@ wind power .
this is in line with the EU &apos;s target to increase renewable energy &apos;s share of electricity generation in the EU @-@ 25 to 22 % by that time .
support for EU development and cooperation policies ( EUR 3.5@@ bn )
FEMIP aims to develop the private sector and social and economic infrastructure in the Mediterranean Partner Countries , with a view to preparing them for the Euro @-@ Mediterranean free trade area envisaged by the Barcelona Process for 2010 .
perceptions of high risk and administrative obstacles hampered foreign direct investment .
however , potential projects are increasingly being identified and the environment for private sector investment in the ACP countries is steadily but surely improving .
borrowing activities in 2004
the EIB strengthened its leading role in the international bond markets .
the volume of borrowing increased by 19 % to EUR 50@@ bn , raised through 282 transactions in 15 currencies .
issuance in EUR ( 35 % of total funding ) and USD ( 36 % ) accounted for the largest share , followed by GBP ( 19 % ) .
the three core currencies ( EUR , GBP , USD ) thus together accounted for 90 % of funding .
currency diversification continued , with issuance in 12 additional currencies ( 10 % of funding ) , mainly currencies of new and future EU Member States .
in addition , the Bank remained responsive to opportunities for targeted and structured issuance .
about 25 % of total funding in 2004 was in mat@@ urities of ten years or longer .
this also helped to diversify the investor base .
USD plac@@ ings with US investors grew , with on average one third of USD benchmark issues being placed with US accounts .
in GBP , the Bank doubled the number of benchmark taps and provided liquidity in mat@@ urities up to 20@@ 54 .
the stronger regional presence in certain other markets benefited from the revival of dor@@ mant segments , notably in AUD and CAD .
the Bank also doubled its issuance in Z@@ AR , reinforcing its position as the largest foreign issuer .
another important area of development was in currencies of new and future EU Member States , where issuance amounted to EUR 1.@@ 2@@ b@@ n.
in this region the Bank not only strengthened liquidity and offered a wider range of mat@@ urities , but also issued in three new currencies ( the Maltese li@@ ra , Slovenian tol@@ ar and Bulgarian lev ) , in each case being the first AAA @-@ rated or sovereign class issuer other than the national government .
as in previous years , the Bank was the largest issuer in the new and future Member States other than local sovereign@@ s .
the further growth in local currency borrowing has also supported EIB lending activity and the Bank &apos;s position as the largest lender in the region .
overall outlook
the EIB does not strive for growth for the sake of growth .
rather , it will intensify its strategy to focus on value added , i.e. more quality than quantity .
value added means :
3. particular financial benefits obtained by the use of EIB funds and the need for such benefits in order to accelerate desired investment .
likewise , lending to Accession and Candidate Countries as well as to non @-@ EU countries could continue to grow at a more sustained pace .
the main lending priorities will remain the same as outlined above .
the EIB , as the European Union &apos;s finance institution contributing to the achievement of the Union &apos;s policy objectives , feels duty @-@ bound to be highly transparent and provide a maximum of information .
as a bank , however , it also has a duty to protect the legitimate commercial and market @-@ sensitive interests of its clients .
between these two interests , the EIB has to strike a balance .
establishing transparency is an ongoing process .
in recent years the EIB has made great progress ; efforts to improve transparency will continue .

Czech Republic : EIB L@@ ends EUR 37 million for the Development of the Moravia @-@ Silesia Regional Infrastructure
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) is lending EUR 37 million for small @-@ scale regional infrastructure schemes supported by EU Structural Funds in the sectors of transport as well as culture and social care .
most of the schemes included in the regional investment programme supported by the Bank concern the upgrading and rehabilitation of the regional road network , which , as in other Czech Regions , has been rapidly deteriorating in recent years as a result of prolonged lack of maintenance and rapidly increasing traffic .
the project will provide funds to address those problems most urgently in need of rehabilitation , thus improving mobility conditions in the most densely populated area of the county .
the EIB loan will also serve to increase the capacity of the terminal of the Ostrava Mo@@ š@@ nov airport , adding 5 000 m ² of space after completion .
500 000 passengers per year .
Mr. Ivan P@@ ili@@ p , the EIB Vice @-@ President responsible for the Bank &apos;s operations in the Czech Republic , stated : &quot;
with the loan we are signing today the Bank is confirming the importance it gives to direct lending to the regions of the new Member States .
the Region of Moravia @-@ Silesia is both the most populated and the most peripheral of the 14 Czech Regions created in 2001 .
at this time of conversion away from its traditional economy founded on heavy industry , it faces the second highest rate of unemployment in the country .
the Bank &apos;s support for the integrated programmes of EU Structural Funds will help to strengthen its competitiveness , particularly through enhanced transport infrastructure coupled with the implementation of the cultural and social elements of this project . &quot;
note for the Editor :
since the start of its operations in the new Member States and Acceding Countries - Bulgaria and Romania - the EIB has provided more than EUR 28 billion for investment projects in these countries .
as such , the EIB is the most significant external source of financing in this region .
the Bank has been consistently awarded a first class ( AAA ) credit rating by the leading rating agencies .
this enables the EIB to mobilise large volumes of funds at advantageous terms .
the Bank on @-@ lends these resources on a non @-@ profit basis to its clients .
this makes it possible to provide medium and long @-@ term loans up to 20 or more years at attractive interest rates , with appropriate grace periods on repayment of principal .

EIB provides loans in Hungary exceeding EUR 1 billion
the EIB is lending EUR 875 million for the construction of the fourth line of Budapest Metro that will contribute to the improvement of the heavily burdened city transport of Budapest with positive impacts on the environment and quality of life in the city .
a loan of EUR 194 million is also being provided for the construction and operation of the new Budapest Central Wa@@ ste@@ water Treatment Plant at C@@ se@@ pel Island as part of a co @-@ financing with the EU Cohesion Funds .
the recent growth in the Bank &apos;s operations reflects a high degree of support for Hungary &apos;s investment needs across a wide range of sectors .
the Bank &apos;s involvement with the Metro IV project stretches back several years .
the loan for the Budapest Metro IV will be used for financing up to 75 % of the construction of a new metro line of 10.5 km with fourteen stations , as well as the acquisition of 22 new five @-@ car train sets to be run on the line .
the new line will provide the first metro crossing of the Danube river between Kel@@ en@@ f@@ öld Railway Station in South Buda on the west side of the Danube and Bos@@ ny@@ ak Square in the centre of Pest .
once operation commen@@ ces on the line , it will decrease the pressure on the road bridges and tram crossings and should contribute to the smoother transport of approximately 17@@ 5,000 inhabitants daily between Pest and South Buda .
the new metro should also assist the rejuven@@ ation of parts of the City and should further promote the role of public transport in Budapest .
operation on the first section between Kel@@ en@@ f@@ öld Railway Station and Kel@@ eti Railway Station is expected to start by end @-@ 2009 , and operation for the second section between Kel@@ eti Railway Station and Bos@@ ny@@ ak Square foreseen to begin by end @-@ 2010 .
the Budapest metro extension will contribute to the reduction of air pollution and vibrations , as well significantly decreasing the noise level in the neighbourhood of the new line .
in addition , surface level transport will be reduced on G@@ ell@@ ert Square , a world heritage site .
the project of the new Budapest Central Wa@@ ste@@ water Treatment Plant involves the design , construction , operation and maintenance of the plant .
it covers the construction of a new system for wastewater collection , treatment and sludge disposal for central Budapest .
it will help to reduce pollution to the Danube and comply with EU Directives on wastewater treatment .
the new central wastewater treatment plant will be the largest of the four wastewater treatment plants within the urban conglomer@@ ation of Greater Budapest .
Mr. Wolfgang Roth , EIB Vice @-@ President , commented :
the new metro line will significantly improve the urban transport network in Budapest with positive consequences for the quality of life in the Hungarian capital from an environmental point of view .
in addition , it will significantly reduce daily comm@@ uting times for the city &apos;s residents .
I am also pleased that the other EIB loan signed today for the City of Budapest will help to improve the environment in the City and the Danube generally and contribute to implementation of EU environmental standards . &quot;

the Committee &apos;s second meeting , in Amsterdam in October , called for the extension of the Trans @-@ European Networks ( TENs ) and the reinforcement of Public Private Partnerships ( PP@@ Ps ) in water and transport in the Mediterranean region .
this formali@@ zes a long history of strong and productive cooperation between the three institutions .
Philippe de Fontaine Vive , EIB Vice @-@ President in charge of FEMIP said : &quot;
the Barcelona Process &quot; undertaking to establish a free trade area between the southern and northern shores of the Mediterranean by 2010 , calls for substantial financial support and a firm political commitment on both sides of the Mediterranean .

the external relations dimension of the Luxembourg Presidency is expanding considerably as the European Union becomes increasingly important on the global stage .
the aim of the Union &apos;s foreign policy is to make the world safer , more prosperous and to ensure greater observance of human rights .
a wide range of instruments is employed to achieve these objectives .
another major priority will be the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy , by which the European Union will pursue the development of its relations with the neighbouring countries of the enlarged Europe .
this policy will be realised by drawing up and adopting action plans with all the neighbouring countries concerned .
the Barcelona process will remain the main framework for a coherent set of privileged relations with countries in the Euro @-@ Mediterranean region .

the EIB Reviews Financing Targets for the Energy Sector
the European Investment Bank has completed a review of its financing targets for energy projects that help to implement the relevant EU policies .
the Bank will focus on five target areas : large projects ; energy efficiency ; renewable energies ; R D for energy and cooperation on energy outside the EU .
EIB energy lending as percentage of its total lending in the EU declined from 23 % in the 1980 &quot; s to 9 % in the period 2000 @-@ 2005 .
the outcome reflects the pattern of energy investment in the EU .
the EIB financed about 5 % of the investments by the energy sector in the EU , at an annual average of some EUR 3.@@ 3. billion in the past five years .
outside the EU financing of energy projects represents a larger part of EIB financing in those countries .
the re@@ priori@@ tization of energy in the Bank &apos;s activities reflects EU policy on climate change and the renewed tensions in the oil market .
according to the new strategy for the EIB Group , the Bank &apos;s role in the EU should evolve from a universal provider of funds to become a flexible partner acting with more tailor @-@ made products adapted to local market circumstances and to the needs of the counterparts .
financing for large energy projects will focus on those with the highest EU priority .
support will go in particular to projects enhancing the security of energy supply and the internal market , including notably priority TENs .
the energy efficiency target areas include financing energy efficiency investment programmes , combined heat and power as well as district heating .
in addition , it will explore with promoters possibilities to develop the energy efficiency potential of their projects financed by the Bank .
in renewable energy the EIB aims at the existing financing targets ( average annual financing is above EUR 500 million ) .
additionally , emphasis will be on developing the less mature renewable markets , both within and outside in the EU , on the underdeveloped renewables ( particularly biomass ) , and on new technologies .
RD for energy will increase under the existing ( i@@ 2i ) policy for a knowledge @-@ based economy .
new risk sharing financial instruments will be developed for this type of projects .
in partner and neighboring countries efforts will go towards a pan @-@ European Energy Community with Neigh@@ boring Countries to better integrate energy markets .
the EIB will also support new energy import routes and projects enhancing energy supply .
in developing countries the EIB will seek to increase access to modern sources of energy and to further sustainable energy solutions , favor@@ ing in particular the emergence of low @-@ carbon economies .

Romania : EUR 20 million for SMEs and municipal investments
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) is providing a EUR 20 million global loan to Ban@@ c@@ post S.A. to finance indirectly investment projects of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and municipalities in Romania .
EIB global loans have been developed as a successful tool for providing long @-@ term funding for smaller projects undertaken usually by SMEs and municipalities .
since 1990 , the EIB has provided global loans to partner banks in Romania totalling EUR 220 million .
this global loan is the first one granted to Ban@@ c@@ post S.A. and it will increase the number of EIB partner banks in Romania to seven .
part of the loan is intended to support municipal projects .
under these operations Romanian municipalities are expected to benefit from the Municipal Finance Facility .
this scheme is subsidised by EU grants under the Phare Programme .
the grant support for municipalities can amount to up to 5 % of the total loan in order to promote municipal investment relating mainly to the building , upgrading or refurbis@@ hing of small @-@ scale municipal infrastructure .
background
the EIB , the European Union &apos;s financing institution , provides funding for sound investments that foster balanced regional development and the economic and social cohesion of the Member States as well as of the Acceding Coun@@ ties ( Romania and Bulgaria ) .
since 1990 the EIB has lent a total of EUR 4.4 billion in Romania .
global loans are special credit lines to selected partner banks operating in the individual countries .
this facility is used by the EIB to finance projects by municipalities and in the SME sector involving a total investment of more than EUR 40 000 and less than EUR 25 million .
EIB partner banks such as Ban@@ c@@ post S.A. then on @-@ lend the EIB funds under their own management , at their own risk and subject to their own terms .

2006 FEMIP Conference : regional integration in the Euro @-@ Mediterranean area through transport systems
including political authorities , CEOs and experts in the field of transport .
the work of the conference , the detailed programme and papers for which can be consulted on the EIB &apos;s website ( ) ,
can be summarised as follows :
1 .
during the past 25 years ( 1980 @-@ 2004 ) , the partner countries on the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean have only benefited to a limited extent from globalisation .
this situation is due in particular to inadequate regional integration in terms of available infrastructure , and the need for structural reform and modernisation of administrative capacity .
regional integration is therefore vital to provide the southern and eastern Mediterranean partner countries with the resources they need to achieve a sustainable growth rate of 6 to 7 % per year in order to meet the challenge of their demogra@@ phy ,
modernise their economies and participate successfully in the globalised economy .
recent economic projections show that high growth rates can be achieved only through &quot; far @-@ reaching regional economic integration , &quot; combining the liberalisation of trade and services with market integration and the implementation of reforms that improve the business climate .
2 .
sectoral policies : objectives and priorities
since its establishment in October 2002 , FEMIP has channelled around EUR 5.5 billion into financing regional infrastructure in the partner countries .
these figures are set to double over the next 20 years .
however , the quality of the freight systems remains inadequate , seriously affecting transport and logistics costs , which account for over 20 % of the final value of the transported goods .
policy in this sector must therefore be comprehensive and cover a number of aspects : technical and administrative interoperability , control of the entire logistics chain , the organisation of routes based on hubs and the intermodal connection of ports with their hinterland .
the Conference therefore endorsed the introduction of a multi@@ modal maritime freight system in the Mediterranean which :
2. integrates technical and administrative interoperability standards into projects ;
passenger numbers are expected to more than double over the next 20 years .
the Conference therefore called for the gradual implementation of the &quot; Euro @-@ Mediterranean single sky &quot; by :
promoting regulatory convergence and technical cooperation , through encouraging access for the southern and eastern Mediterranean partner countries to agencies specialising in air traffic control and safety ;
up@@ porting the widespread application of international standards ;
background information :
accordingly , FEMIP provides the partner countries with :
a forum for exchanging expertise , through meetings of FEMIP &apos;s Ministerial Committee , its Committees of Experts and the FEMIP conferences ;
financial products that are appropriate in terms of loan mat@@ urities ( 15 @-@ 20 years ) , risk @-@ taking ( through the introduction of the Special FEMIP En@@ velop@@ e )
improved coordination between lenders , i.e. the European Commission , the 15 European Development Finance Institutions ( ED@@ F@@ Is ) , the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank .
as an ad@@ jun@@ ct to this activity , FEMIP has also stepped up discussions with representatives from the private sector and civil society .
more than twenty meetings with the business community have been organised by FEMIP , both in the EU and the partner countries , some of them in conjunction with the other IF@@ Is .
furthermore , FEMIP is also a permanent observer at the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , works with the associations of Euro @-@ Mediterranean towns and regions and has forged relations with a number of universities and academic institutes , such as the FEM@@ ISE network and the &quot; Cer@@ cle des Econom@@ ist@@ es . &quot;
see the FEM@@ ISE reports , in particular &quot; 10 years after Barcelona : achievements and perspectives &quot; ( June 2005 ) , 2005 Annual Report ( June 2006 ) and country profiles ( 2004 @-@ 2006 ) .
according to the most widely accepted estimates , the partner countries must create 2 to 2.5 million new jobs annually over 15 years to hold their current unemployment rates in check .
estimate of annual growth resulting from a far @-@ reaching integration process over the period 2005 @-@ 2015 : Algeria : 6.2 % ; Tunisia : 5.8 % ; Morocco : 5.7 % .
published at end @-@ 2004 by the Euro@@ Med Transport Project Forum , and in the Final Report of the &quot; High Level Group on the extension of the trans @-@ European transport network to neighbouring countries , &quot; submitted at end @-@ 2005 by Ms Loyola de Palacio .
the region produces approximately 720 million tonnes of international maritime freight a year ( including 270 million tonnes of oil and gas ) .
of this , intra @-@ Mediterranean trade represents 40 % and trade between the Euro @-@ Mediterranean area and the rest of the world 60 % .
and increase ei@@ ght@@ fold with respect to con@@ tain@@ er@@ ised freight .
100 million international passengers a year use the 24 airports in the Euro @-@ Mediterranean area that handle traffic of more than 1 million passengers / year .
here the FEMIP studies under way on maritime logistics platforms in the Mediterranean region provide a favourable precedent .

Croatia : EUR 60 million for road rehabilitation
the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) lends EUR 60 million to the Republic of Croatia for the rehabilitation of 6@@ 87 km of the Croatian national road network divided to 52 sections across the country .
the loan will contribute to the implementation of the Croatian Programme for the Construction and Maintenance of Public Ro@@ ads for the period of 2005 @-@ 2008 .
Croatia is an important transit country for passenger and goods and an adequate transport infrastructure will help the country better integrate with the European Union &apos;s Single Market .
in addition , it will increase the transport safety and capacity needed to face successfully the increasing number of vehicles since the recent years .
the project is focused on the modernisation and maintenance of roads along major Croatian transport ar@@ teries with positive implications for the development of the tourism industry being one of the most significant sectors for the country &apos;s economic development .
the current loan is a continuation of a successful cooperation of the Bank with this company .
in 2001 , the EIB provided a loan of EUR 60 million to the CR for co @-@ financing the rehabilitation of the national road network and in July 2005 the Bank signed with the CR another loan of EUR 60 million for the construction of the bypass road of the city of Split .
background
since 2001 , EIB lending in Croatia has exceeded EUR 900 million .
the EIB lending has been focused on the construction and rehabilitation of the country &apos;s infrastructure , especially transport infrastructure , which has absorbed some 60 % of total EIB lending in Croatia .
the completion of the Rijeka @-@ Zagreb motorway , the construction of the motorway section Zu@@ pan@@ ja @-@ Li@@ po@@ vac and the Split by @-@ pass represent the major projects financed by the EIB in this concern .
in addition , the Bank in Croatia finances investments of small and medium @-@ sized companies through local financial institutions , and lends support to projects in the areas of industry and services .
in the near future the Bank envisages extending its operations to the environmental , health and education sectors .
this implies a growing number of loans to the private sector and municipalities to support investment .

press release
the European Investment Bank Group in 2006
in 2006 the European Investment Bank Group , the banking group promoting European objectives , continued its activities aimed at modernising the economies of the Member States and of the countries close to the Union .
tr@@ engthening the leverage of the EIB &apos;s operations ;
fostering economic convergence between the Union and its partner countries .
in 2006 , the European Investment Bank lent a total of EUR 45.@@ 8@@ bn for projects promoting the European Union &apos;s policy objectives .
finance for the then EU @-@ 25 Member States represented 87 % of its activities and amounted to EUR 39.@@ 8@@ b@@ n.
to fund its activities , the EIB raised an aggregate amount of EUR 48@@ bn on the international capital markets through 303 bond issues in 24 currencies .
the briefing notes attached to this press release give a detailed account of the Bank &apos;s activity in 2006 in line with its operational objectives based on six priorities within the Union and support for the three policies outside the Union .
the key strategic and action points can be summarised as follows :
within an enlarged Union of 27 Member States , the EIB Group is committed to being an economic development agent and partner ,
mobilising financial resources to :
upport the economic modernisation of the new Member States ;
maintain a high level of investment in public services ;
contribute to the technological competitiveness of the Union and the development of its SMEs ;
meet the challenges facing the European energy sector and tackle climate change ;
foster cooperation with specialised national and international institutions .
a few examples will serve to illustrate this proactive approach taken by the EIB Group .
it will thus be possible to allocate part of the Structural Funds for financial engineering purposes in areas providing support for SMEs and micro @-@ enterprises ( JER@@ EMIE ) or for urban social development ( JESSICA ) .
the third initiative ( JAS@@ PER@@ S ) - financed by the Commission , the EIB Group and the EBRD - offers free technical assistance with identifying and implementing infrastructure projects in the new Member States that are eligible for financing by the Structural Funds .
several projects have already been pin@@ pointed under these facilities .
it should be stressed that this technical assistance does not entail any obligation to seek cofinancing from the EIB or EBRD .
these two financial instruments will act as a catalyst in attracting up to EUR 20@@ bn of additional public or private finance in support of TENs .
requested by the December 2005 European Council , it could leverage up to EUR 10@@ bn of additional funds over the period 2007 @-@ 2013 .
at the same time , the EIF is set to give a fresh boost to support for SMEs with an increase in capital - now under preparation - and by making a further EUR 1.@@ 1@@ bn available under the 2007 @-@ 2013 &quot; Competitiveness and Innovation &quot;
framework Programme for deploying innovative financial products , particularly for SME start @-@ ups .
in so doing it is committed to supporting all 27 Member States , even though in relative terms priority will be given to the 12 new Member States .
the six European priorities on which EIB lending focuses are :
with the reorientation of EU cohesion policy for the period 2007 @-@ 2013 , the EIB will in future also focus its cohesion financing operations on the &quot; convergence regions . &quot;
a competitive and innovative European economy , thanks to additional funding for research and innovation .
in 2006 the Bank pumped EUR 8.@@ 4@@ bn into this objective ( EUR 7.@@ 6@@ bn within the Union and EUR 7@@ 38@@ m for extensions in nei@@ g@@ bo@@ uring countries ) .
upport for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises was confirmed in 2006 with a record level of bank credit lines of EUR 5.@@ 8@@ bn as well as a record volume of guarantees ( EUR 2@@ bn ) and venture capital operations ( EUR 68@@ 8@@ m ) .
this policy of support for SMEs will receive a further boost in 2007 ( see briefing note on support for SMEs ) ;
the &quot; climate change &quot; dimension of environmental protection but also that of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of life in urban areas .
this priority objective of sustainable urban development directly accounts for more than a third of the EUR 10.@@ 9@@ bn worth of EIB lending for the environment .
3 .
acknowledging the importance of the EIB &apos;s contribution to implementing the financial aspects of the Union &apos;s aid and cooperation policies towards its partner countries , the December 2006 European Council increased the Bank &apos;s possibilities for action outside the Union over the period 2007 @-@ 2013 by more than a third ( to EUR 27.@@ 8@@ bn ) .
three fields of action with specific objectives have been identified :
the EUR 10.@@ 2@@ bn in loans over the period 2000 @-@ 2006 helped the 12 new Member States to prepare for joining the EU , in particular by speeding up their links with the Union and improving their public services .
in 2006 , including loans to Bulgaria and Romania , the EIB provided finance totalling EUR 3.@@ 2@@ bn to the enlargement countries ( see briefing note on preparing for enlargement ) ;
the process of convergence with the Union &apos;s neighbours , which ,
with a total of EUR 12.@@ 4@@ bn in loans guaranteed by the Union , represents the EIB &apos;s biggest mandate ever .
with regard to sub @-@ Saharan Africa and the Caribbean and Pacific States , the EIB lent EUR 8@@ 25@@ m in 2006 , with priority being given to support for SMEs and energy projects .
this economic input will be maintained over the period 2007 @-@ 2013 , with a lending capacity of nearly EUR 4@@ bn .
a major effort has been decided in favour of operations in Latin America and to a lesser extent Asia , with the ceiling for the periods in question being increased from EUR 2.5@@ bn to EUR 3.@@ 8@@ bn - for the first time the ceiling is sub@@ divided ( indicative figures ) into EUR 2.8@@ bn for Latin America and EUR 1@@ bn for Asia .
4 .
borrowing : strategy adds value for customers
this remains a cornerstone of cost @-@ effective funding .
benchmark issues in the Bank &apos;s three core currencies raised EUR 28@@ bn equivalent ( 59 % of total funding ) .
of this , the largest amount was raised in euros ( EUR 10.@@ 6@@ bn ) , followed by USD ( EUR 9.@@ 7@@ bn equivalent ) and GBP ( EUR 8.@@ 0@@ bn equivalent ) .
a number of innovations and distinctive features differentiated 2006 activities in core currencies .
ce@@ menting the Bank &apos;s reputation for offering customers alternatives across the yield curve .
in USD the Bank extended its yield curve with a new USD 30 @-@ year benchmark issue , the first to follow revival of this maturity by the US Treasury .
acceding / Accession Countries and EU partner countries remained an important feature .
the largest source of demand remained in Turkish li@@ ra , where the Bank raised EUR 1.@@ 1@@ bn equivalent and continued to develop its liquidity and yield curve .
the Bank launched its first floating rate note in Bulgarian lev@@ a and issued bonds in three further currencies from this region ( CZK , HUF and PLN ) .
outside Europe it launched a first issue in Egyptian pounds as well as in Botswana pul@@ a and Nami@@ bian dollars ( in synthetic format ) .

European Investment Bank and World Bank Jo@@ in Forces to T@@ ack@@ le Climate Change
the CF@@ E , a trust fund established by the World Bank , in cooperation with the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , is designed to help European countries meet their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union &apos;s Emissions Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) .
the fund will purchase greenhouse gas emission reductions through the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) and Joint Implementation ( JI ) from climate @-@ friendly investment projects from either bank &apos;s portfolio as well as self @-@ standing projects .
they include : Ireland , Luxembourg ,
Portugal , Flemish Region and Stat@@ kraft Carbon Invest AS ( Norway ) .
Luxembourg &apos;s Minister for Environment , Lu@@ cien LUX ,
said : &quot;
Luxembourg , with an ambitious 28 % emission reductions target under the Kyoto Protocol , has decided to work with the World Bank and the European Investment Bank by participating in the CF@@ E .
we perceive the CF@@ E as a good instrument for further development of the CDM and JI in the interest of the communities involved and as a tool for the protection of our global climate . &quot;
speaking on behalf of the Government of Portugal , N@@ uno Lac@@ ast@@ a of the Portuguese DNA Secretariat said ,
&quot; Portugal is very pleased to participate in the CF@@ E .
Portugal &apos;s Kyoto implementation strategy includes ambitious domestic measures - such as renewables - and also the use of the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s market mechanisms .
the Portuguese Carbon Fund &apos;s investment in the CF@@ E is an important means to meet the national objectives as the World Bank in particular has a proven track record in managing carbon investments . &quot;
according to Kris Pe@@ eters , Flemish Minister for Public Works , Energy , the Environment and Nature ,
&quot; the Flemish Region decided to participate in the CF@@ E because it is one of the rare opportunities in the market that fulfils some key elements : large experience in this fast growing market , a framework for sustainable investments and balanced risk management .
while the World Bank brings its expertise and experience of the carbon market to the CF@@ E , the EIB brings its intimate knowledge of the European economy and a rich project pipeline in developing countries .
through the CF@@ E , the two institutions will complement private sector development in the emerging carbon market and seek ways to support essential private carbon market development .
according to Simon Brooks , EIB Vice @-@ President ,
&quot; we are at the beginning of a long process to stabilize the climate system , reduce the rate of climate change and manage its adverse effects .
involving the development and financing of new ideas , innovative solutions and associated technologies , to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
there is no single &quot; golden bullet &quot; to solving the problems of climate change .
instead , we need a broad range of separate initiatives that bring together the experience and knowledge of public and private interests .
the lessons learned from the activities and successes of the Carbon Fund for Europe should inspire new endea@@ vors in the long battle to protect our future . &quot;
&quot; this partnership with the EIB is one more critical element in helping the world to move towards a low carbon economy , &quot;
the fact that the fund will buy beyond 2012 is sending an important message for the need for a post 2012 stable regulatory regime . &quot;
the fund may purchase carbon credits generated by a project beyond 2012 - up to a limit of 40 % .
implementing entities will include private sector companies which will be selected by public procurement processes .
European banks and financial institutions will also be invited to collaborate with the fund .
the CF@@ E is interested in projects that already have clear implementation plans and that have a defined operational start date .
it will consider all types of emission reduction or removal projects .
anyone can submit projects to the CF@@ E , as long as projects are credible and financially sound .

JAS@@ PER@@ S regional office in Vienna opened
today in Vienna , Matthias Kol@@ lat@@ z @-@ Ah@@ nen , Vice @-@ President of the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , Dirk Ah@@ ner , Director General of the Directorate General for Regional Policy in the European Commission and Alexander Au@@ bo@@ eck , Business Group Director for Infrastructure at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) , opened the new regional office for the JAS@@ PER@@ S facility .
JAS@@ PER@@ S - Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions - is an initiative established in 2006 by the European Commission and the two banks which helps the EU Member States in Central and Eastern Europe to develop high quality projects that will receive support from the EU &apos;s Structural and Cohesion Funds .
the majority of the JAS@@ PER@@ S experts will be based in regional offices so that they can work closely with the beneficiaries .
the Vienna office is the second regional office of JAS@@ PER@@ S to be officially opened , following the opening of the first in Warsaw last January .
Vienna has been selected as the location of the office in the central European area for logistical reasons , being centrally located and providing easy access to the four beneficiary countries .
EIB Vice @-@ President Matthias Kol@@ lat@@ z @-@ Ah@@ nen commented at the opening ceremony :
&quot; in nearly fifty years of existence , the EIB has gained valuable expertise in financing projects in priority areas for EU regional policies .
the JAS@@ PER@@ S office in Vienna is expected to be a significant tool in sharing this expertise , together with our partners from the Commission and the EBRD .
it will provide technical assistance to four new Member States in developing projects suitable for EU funding , but also in using the Union &apos;s resources in the best possible way . &quot;
Director General Ah@@ ner said : &quot;
the opening of the JAS@@ PER@@ S office in Vienna is an important further step in developing cooperation between the European Commission , the EIB and the EBRD .
combining the resources and experience of the three partners allows JAS@@ PER@@ S to offer more effective assistance to the beneficiary countries , who will be better able to make use of the substantial volume of EU investment funds now available .
more effective investment will lead in turn to higher growth and competitiveness , which is the objective of the EU &apos;s cohesion policy . &quot;
noted : &quot;
the EBRD has been operating successfully in Central and Eastern Europe since 1991 , and its presence in these countries is an important element for implementation of this programme .
we believe that the JAS@@ PER@@ S regional office in Vienna will substantially strengthen the ability to provide input on the ground to the beneficiaries of EU funds in the Czech Republic , Hungary , Slovakia and Slovenia . &quot;
assistance from JAS@@ PER@@ S is provided free of charge to the beneficiaries and is based on the contribution of staff resources from the EIB and the EBRD combined with financial resources from the technical assistance budget of the European Commission .
a third regional office of JAS@@ PER@@ S has been established in Bucharest to assist the development of projects in Romania and Bulgaria and will be officially opened in June .

2006 : a successful year crowned by the reinforcement of FEMIP
it also launched a cooperation policy with Euro @-@ Mediterranean universities .
taking note of these results , at the end of 2006 the European Council endowed FEMIP with a lending / guarantee envelope of EUR 8.7 billion within the overall amount of EUR 12.@@ 4 billion allocated to the European Neighbourhood Policy .
it also expanded FEMIP &apos;s twofold mission : to foster private sector development and the creation of an investment @-@ friendly environment .
2007 : new financial products and enhancement of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean dialogue
to meet this challenge , the FEMIP Finance Ministers have based their strategy for the years ahead on two pillars :
continuing the policy of dialogue and involvement of all economic players in the process of discussing and raising awareness of the need for social and economic reforms , and enhancing the partner countries &quot; sense of ownership .
to this end , FEMIP recently created a special committee bringing together representatives of the EU Member States , the partner countries and the European Commission .
this committee will approve FEMIP &apos;s annual report , prepare the three @-@ year @-@ FEMIP activity programme and give its opinion on sectoral strategies and the development of new financial products .
FEMIP and the European Neighbourhood Policy
FEMIP has been focusing its loan and guaran@@ ty activity on the development of partner countries &quot; private sector and foremost on that of the SMEs .
these instruments have a strong leverage effect on the Community budgetary resources allocated to the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership .
through its operations , FEMIP is transferring to the partner countries the experience gained in Europe by the EIB .
in parallel , FEMIP will continue to closely cooperate with the international financial institutions active in the region , with which it co @-@ financed almost one third of its operations in 2006 .
with its role thus reaffirmed and enhanced , FEMIP is the financial instrument for implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy on the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean .
on the strength of its experience and success with fostering the modernisation of the emerging Mediterranean countries , FEMIP can even provide a model for the operations to be mounted in Europe &apos;s new &quot; eastern neighbours , &quot; where the EIB is also active .

a key partner in this pilot project is the Municipality of Leipzig , on account of its extensive experience with the EU URBAN initiative , which expired in 2006 .

the European Commission &apos;s JESSICA initiative represents the first step towards using ERDF structural funds for urban development on a more sustainable basis than before .
the Saxony Urban Development Fund will be tested and further developed during the support period 2007 @-@ 2013 .
previously , only grants were usually available for urban development .
now a variety of loans on favourable terms can also be offered for selected projects via the Fund .
with a view to the reduction of subsidies after the expiry of the current support period in 2013 , this alternative financing instrument offers advantages to all parties as the Fund &apos;s resources can be granted repeatedly and will continue to be available after the end of the support period .
the Saxony solution could be implemented in other German Länder in a similar form .
the Federal Ministry of Transport , Construction and Urban Affairs has picked up on the Commission &apos;s initiative and created a special JESSICA working group in which Saxony &apos;s interior ministry , SA@@ B and KfW will also participate .
if the pilot phase in Leipzig is successful , SA@@ B will make the urban development fund available to all cities in the Free State .

energy and Climate Change issues have received high attention from the Bank .
these measures include :
a further increase in lending for renewable energy ; the targets for lending in this sector ( EUR 600 @-@ 800 million per year ) are now considered as minimum figures ;
developing financial instruments including framework facilities for smaller @-@ scale investments and using structured finance and investment funds ;
introducing a systematic review of energy efficiency issues when assessing projects to be supported by the Bank .
in addition , the Governors have endorsed a set of screening criteria for the financing of coal / lign@@ ite power stations , in order to ensure that any use of carbon @-@ intensive fuels in EIB @-@ supported projects is still compatible with the overall targets for greenhouse gas emissions .
in the framework of the same proposal and in order to further support energy projects in Neighbourhood Countries , ACP , South Africa and ALA , the Governors approved the establishment of a dedicated EUR 3 billion facility from EIB own resources .

EIB launches new Post @-@ 2012 Carbon Fund , the first carbon fund targeting post @-@ Kyoto credits
the European Investment Bank &apos;s EUR 100 million Post @-@ 2012 Carbon Fund was launched today in Ljubljana during the 2007 EIB Forum devoted to the topic of &quot; Invest@@ ing in Energy - Mastering Climate Change . &quot;
the development of the Fund is a direct result of on @-@ going cooperation in the field of climate change between the EIB and three leading European national financing institutions : Instituto de Cré@@ di@@ to O@@ ficial ( ICO ) , KfW Bank@@ engruppe and the Nordic Investment Bank ( NI@@ B ) .
the Post @-@ 2012 Carbon Fund is designed to underpin the market value of carbon emission reduction units produced after the expiry of the current Kyoto Protocol in 2012 .
the Bank and its partners have designed the Fund to encourage and facilitate investment in projects which will give rise to carbon credits in a longer term time perspective than is currently generally the case .
the Fund will support the development of environmentally beneficial projects including renewable energy , energy efficiency , forestry and methane capture , via the acquisition of carbon credits generated by the mitigation , prevention ,
the day @-@ to @-@ day activities of the Post 2012 Carbon Fund will be undertaken , within the terms of detailed operating and policy guidelines , by an independent fund management team .
with its focus exclusively on post @-@ Kyoto credits , the Post @-@ 2012 Carbon Fund will be materially different from not only the other carbon finance activities of the EIB , but also those more generally in the market .
other EIB Carbon Funds
protection and improvement of the environment , including tackling climate change , are key priorities for the EU and thus for the EIB .
in addition to the Post @-@ 2012 Carbon Fund , the Bank has established three other carbon funds .
the Fund will expand the supply of carbon credits in Central Europe and Central Asia .
country participants can also participate via the M@@ CC@@ F in Green Investment Schem@@ es to facilitate trade in carbon credits between governments .
the Fund purchases greenhouse gas emission reductions through the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) and Joint Initiative ( JI )
forestry and methane ) .
the Programme provides an excellent example of cooperative working between the EIB and KfW , clearly drawing on the respective strengths of each organisation .
the two institutions will jointly oversee fund management activities .
other EIB climate change initiatives
in its approach to supporting climate change projects the EIB ensures that the investments it finances are compliant with EU environmental principles and standards , enshrined in the European Principles for the Environment ( EP@@ E ) ( see ) .
in addition , the EUR 3 billion &quot; Facility for Energy Sustainability and Security of Supply &quot; approved by the Board of Governors in June 2007 is expected to yield a number of carbon credit generating projects , notably through the China Climate Change Framework Facility , for possible acquisition by EIB @-@ sponsored Carbon Funds .
the Bank also has a Climate Change Technical Assistance Facility ( CC@@ T@@ AF ) to provide u@@ pf@@ ront funding for activities associated with the development of project @-@ based carbon assets under the project @-@ based mechanisms , Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) and Joint Implementation ( JI ) of the Kyoto Protocol .
finally , a number of studies have been carried out or are being planned which interact with the Carbon Fund activities of the EIB and reinforce the Bank &apos;s strategy in the field of climate change .

both power plant projects will be promoted by the Holding Sloven@@ ske Elektr@@ ar@@ ne Group ( Slovenian Electrical Power Utility ) , which is responsible for well over 50 % of total electricity production in Slovenia .
the EIB has a well @-@ developed and productive cooperation with the H@@ SE Group .
these projects will be pursued by Slovenian municipalities , public and private companies , as well as individual households .
eco Fund will on lend to projects with a particular focus on energy efficiency , renewable &quot; green &quot; energy ( biomass , solar and wind energy ) , and water and wastewater projects .
this loan is a continuation of the successful cooperation with the Eco Fund that benefited from an EIB loan of EUR 10 million in 2001 .
these funds were fully used to co @-@ finance investments by the Slovenian public and corporate sector , contributing to the reduction of water and air pollution in line with the Slovenian National Environmental Action Plan .

UK social housing receives welcome finance boost from EIB
EIB funds will be on@@ lent by TH@@ FC to registered social land@@ lords ( R@@ SL@@ s ) to undertake social housing improvement projects as part of well @-@ defined urban regeneration schemes .
the EIB funded project will improve living conditions to benefit those UK residents who are most in need of affordable housing .
urban regeneration and social cohesion are priority objectives of the EIB and the Bank lends its full support to the UK government &apos;s goal to provide more , higher quality , and greener houses by 2020 .
in 2008 , two new bodies were created to regulate the recently modified legal environment for social housing .
the Ten@@ ant Services Authority ( T@@ SA ) and the Homes and Communities Agency ( H@@ CA ) are respectively in charge of the regulation of the social housing sector , which includes land@@ lord accreditation and the enforcement of housing standards , and the investment in the sector .
both organisations were represented alongside TH@@ FC and the EIB at the loan signature ceremony in London .
Simon Brooks , EIB Vice President responsible for the Bank &apos;s activities in the UK , said ,
&quot; today &apos;s signature represents more than simply the conclusion of the fifth EIB loan to TH@@ FC , with whom we have worked so successfully for many years .
shortages in social housing alongside population growth and changing demo@@ graphics have resulted in high demand for rented social housing .
the EIB &apos;s GBP 100 million loan will be used to increase the number of available housing units , enhance energy efficiency , improve health conditions for tenants and alleviate unemployment @-@ related problems .
this EIB loan is timely given the current difficulty faced by many potential borrowers to access finance .

around 50 schemes have already been identified to benefit from this loan and more will follow .

a flagship regional project
the project is :
of significant economic importance for Namibia and the surrounding region ;
the recipient of the largest EU @-@ Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund contribution to @-@ date ;
an example of strengthened relations between international financial institutions in Africa .
constant and reliable power supply is a prerequisite for developing economies .
Namibia suffers regular interruptions in imported electricity which is sourced principally from South Africa .
the EUR 15 million interest rate subsidy which the project is receiving from the Trust Fund is also designed to make the project more affordable to Nami@@ bian electricity customers .
at EUR 15 million , the interest rate subsidy is the largest assistance provided to a cross @-@ border infrastructure in Africa since the Trust Fund was established in 2007 .
should the project generate a higher return than expected , the subsidy will be injected into a development account to finance electricity for poorer segments of Nami@@ bian society .
for the first time , the EIB , Agence Française de Dé@@ veloppement ( AF@@ D ) and Kredi@@ tan@@ stalt für Wiederaufbau ( KfW ) jointly app@@ raised the project and the three financing institutions will each lend 12 % of the total project cost .

the operation was signed today in Naples by EIB Vice @-@ President D@@ ario Scann@@ api@@ eco and the President of the Campania Region , Antonio Bas@@ sol@@ ino .
at the same time , D@@ ario Scann@@ api@@ eco signed with the Campania Region , on behalf of the European Investment Fund , an institution owned by the EIB , the first JER@@ EMIE ( Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises )
agreement in Italy to establish a holding fund , in which the Campania Region will invest EUR 90 million .
the EUR 1 billion loan from the EIB will be dedicated in particular to projects in the environmental , tourism , transport and urban renewal sectors .
however , to maintain the flexibility required to implement Campania &apos;s regional development plan , other sectors may be added as a result of specific analysis and in agreement with the Bank .
furthermore , projects costing more than EUR 25 million will be subject to special appraisal by the EIB .
these resources supplement the EU funds and the implementation of the financing plan will help Campania to meet the objectives of the regional development plan .
meanwhile , the new JER@@ EMIE holding fund will provide , via financial intermediaries , resources to be deployed in the form of loan portfolio guarantees , venture capital and micro@@ credits to innovative start @-@ ups ,
micro @-@ enterprises and local SMEs .
&quot; the operations signed today confirm the EIB Group &apos;s commitment to supporting the development of Campania , which along with Calabria , Puglia and Sicily is one of Italy &apos;s Convergence Objective regions .
these regions are an operational priority for the Bank , &quot; remarked Mr Scann@@ api@@ eco .
&quot; this loan to the Region , like the EUR 400 million loan signed recently with Calabria , includes technical assistance from EIB staff to the Region in arranging and implementing particularly complex operations .
apart from providing the financial resources , the EIB will therefore work together with the Region to ensure the quality of the investments . &quot;
Campania is , in fact , the first region to show its willingness to adopt this facility ,
associated in general with the activities of the EIB , also reaffirms the EIB Group &apos;s commitment to supporting the development of SMEs , a key business segment for the national economy that might particularly feel the effects of the current financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; it will be possible to speed up the financing of projects provided for in the European Regional Development Fund &apos;s Operating Programme for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
&quot; and bol@@ sters its reputation in the eyes of the international community .
the terms of the loan , which are altogether favourable ,
for the first time , the two programming exercises share the same objectives and apply to the same period .
Campania has in the past benefited from EIB financing .
the EUR 300 million loan for the region &apos;s development under the Regional Operational Programme 2000 @-@ 2006 , approved by the Bank in 2001 , was deployed in full and used according to the set objectives .

&quot; I am especially pleased to sign this agreement , the first of its type in Italy following the EIB &apos;s adoption at the end of September of a more flexible version of its loan to financial intermediaries in support of SMEs , &quot; remarked Mr Scann@@ api@@ eco .
managed through its network of accredited financial intermediaries , the EIB &apos;s &quot; new loan for SMEs &quot; has a simpler , more flexible format compared to the traditional global loan in order to reach an ever @-@ increasing number of SMEs in an even more transparent and efficient manner .
including an increase in the Bank &apos;s financing threshold for SMEs from 50 % to 100 % of the investment cost , up to a maximum of EUR 12.5 million .

&quot; total lending of some EUR 70 bn would mean a truly significant contribution in terms of liquidity to European banks , corpor@@ ates and public sector clients . &quot;
lending has advanced particularly strongly in three key areas targeted by the Recovery Package : small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) ; energy and mitigation of climate change ; and investment in the poorer , &quot; convergence &quot; regions of the EU .
loan signatures in all three of these areas in the five months to end @-@ May show a clear increase over the equivalent period of 2008 .
lending for SMEs amounted to EUR 4.4 bn to end @-@ May - more than half the full @-@ year target of EUR 8 bn - while loans for energy and mitigation of climate change reached EUR 3.9 bn against a full @-@ year target of EUR 9 bn .
loans to support convergence have been signed for EUR 7.7 bn in the year to date , compared with a 2009 target of EUR 22 bn .
as well as providing extra liquidity , the EIB is helping to ease the impact of widespread risk aversion in the wider financial sector by expanding its activities into a broader range of financial products than ever before .
this entails taking on greater levels of calculated risk , while maintaining tight controls to ensure that the EIB remains on a solid footing within safe financial boundaries .
for example , approvals for sub @-@ investment grade loans financed under the Struc@@ tured Finance Facility ( &quot; SF@@ F &quot; ) amounted to EUR 6.4 bn over the past nine months - almost as much as outstanding stock .
the EIB Group &apos;s capacity to take on more risk is also being expanded through new guarantee products , an extended range of risk @-@ taking instruments for the financing of SMEs and Mid@@ Cap@@ s , and increased availability of equity and quasi equity finance in critical sectors .

Lithuania teams up with EIB to support sustainable cities
the agreement is under the joint European Commission and EIB initiative , supported by the Council of Europe Development Bank , Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas ( JESSICA ) .
the agreement foresees the establishment of a special JESSICA Holding Fund .
the initial capital of the fund will amount to EUR 227 million .
this consists of an allocation from the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) and a budgetary contribution from Lithuania , financed through an EIB loan .
this is the largest JESSICA Holding Fund set up so far and the first one focused on energy efficiency for urban areas investments .
the fund will provide financing for energy efficiency projects in the housing sector through the Lithuanian banks .
the fund will therefore contribute to reduce energy consumption and achieve other associated goals , such as reduction of emissions and improvement of quality of life .
Jessica is focused on the promotion of sustainable investment and growth in urban areas .
this initiative enables the EU Member States and their regions to use some of their EU Structural Fund allocations , to make re@@ payable investments in projects forming part of an integrated plan for sustainable urban development .
these investments , which may take the form of equity , loans and / or guarantees , are delivered to projects via Urban Development Funds .
this will take place in Lithuania via the funds established in the participating banks .
note for the editor :
in the prevailing economic context , the European Investment Bank Group , the banking group promoting European objectives , stepped up its activities in 2008 by additional 15@@ bn EUR lending in 2009 and 2010 each .
the European Investment Bank as an European Institution prompts economic recovery in the European Union as a whole and in Lithuania .
the Bank &apos;s action through increased lending is targeted at the real economy through three main areas : support for small and medium sized entities ( SMEs ) , investments to protect the climate ( including research , development and production of &quot; clean &quot; cars ) ; and investment in the less well off &quot; convergence &apos; regions of the EU .
total EIB lending rose by 21 percent in 2008 to EUR 57@@ bn , compared to EUR 48@@ bn in 2007 .
loan signatures rose sharply towards the end of the year , reflecting the EIB &apos;s swift response to help underpin economic recovery at the request of the European Union &apos;s Member States .
since the accession of Lithuania into the EU in 2004 , the European Investment Bank provided loans in the country tot@@ aling to EUR 1.@@ 28 billion .

press RELEASE
EUR 250 million for energy efficiency in Finland , Poland and Sweden
the European Investment Bank is bol@@ stering energy efficiency in Finland , Poland and Sweden with a EUR 250 million loan to Fort@@ um Corporation , headquartered in Espoo , Finland .
the loan is for the ongoing construction of two cogeneration plants located in Finland and Poland , as well as the implementation of digital remote metering infrastructure in Sweden .
on this occasion , EIB Vice @-@ President Eva Sre@@ j@@ ber stated : &quot;
the first concerns the implementation of a large @-@ scale , natural gas @-@ fired combined @-@ cycle gas turbine plant at Espoo , Finland , replacing an older plant .
thanks to the new plant - to be commissioned in autumn 2009 - the use of coal and oil in district heat production in the area will decrease .
the second scheme consists of a medium @-@ sized co@@ al- and biomass @-@ fired plant at Cz@@ est@@ o@@ cho@@ wa , Poland .
according to plan , the Cz@@ est@@ o@@ cho@@ wa plant will begin production in 2010 .
the project includes also the installation of an automatic metering management infrastructure for the promoter &apos;s power distribution operations in Sweden .
the meters will enable remote reading , provide real @-@ time consumption information and allow differential pricing according to the system load .
the project is in line with the EU Action Plan for Energy Efficiency , which promotes the expansion of combined heat and power in Europe , and it supports climate change initiatives by promoting efficient generating technologies and the use of biomass for energy production .
the introduction of digital metering is expected to contribute to the development of a harmonised pan @-@ Nordic electricity retail market and energy efficiency through automatic meter management standardisation .
furthermore , that part of the project located in Poland also contributes to convergence objectives .
background information :
its mission is to support through its activities the development of EU policies .
to that end , it borro@@ ws its funds on the capital markets in order to finance on the keen@@ est terms projects that are in line with EU strategies .
in 2008 , the EIB made available EUR 5@@ 1.5@@ bn in support of projects located in the European Union .
EIB financing contributes primarily towards economic and social cohesion , environmental protection , research and innovation , support for SMEs , the development of trans @-@ European transport and energy networks and the promotion of sustainable , competitive and safe energy .
already in 2009 , over EUR 5@@ bn has been approved by the EIB &apos;s Board of Directors for loans in support of energy .
in the five @-@ year period 2004 @-@ 2008 , the European Investment Bank provided a total of EUR 3.6 bn for projects in Finland .

enlargement : the CoR exposes the candidate countries &apos; complete neglect of local and regional authorities
this debate was chaired by Luc Van den Brande , who also set out the next steps in following up the CoR &apos;s White Paper on Multi@@ level Governance .
Georgios Pap@@ aster@@ gi@@ ou &apos;s draft opinion gives a frank assessment of the progress that each of the candidate countries has made towards accession .
what makes it unique , however , is its evaluation of how the candidate countries have got local and regional authorities involved in their preparations for accession .
for example , with regard to Turkey the rapporteur expresses &quot; dissatisfaction at the total lack of progress with transferring responsibilities to local authorities , &quot; and also &quot; notes that alignment with the acquis in the area of regional policy and coordination of structural instruments are still limited . &quot;
these comments complement the European Commission &apos;s general assessment in its communication in October and the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament in February .
we want to move towards a European Charter on multi@@ level governance , which will establish the foundations for inclusive governance procedures in Europe .
as chair of CI@@ V@@ EX , I will ensure that we keep on building our relations with our institutional partners by making them accountable for the stance taken on CoR recommendations . &quot;
to that end , he stated that follow @-@ up of opinions adopted by the CoR would be included as a specific item on the agenda of each CI@@ V@@ EX Commission meeting .
CI@@ V@@ EX will also need to keep a close eye on the implementation of the new Stockholm Programme , and will be involved in the European Citizens &apos; Initiative and continue to foster active citizenship .
according to Luc Van den Brande , &quot; such intensified modes of cooperation must be sought in other areas , such as the Eastern Partnership and the Northern Dimension . &quot;

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
the Europe 2020 Strategy needs local and regional authorities if it is to fully achieve its goals
the Committee of the Regions welcomes the objectives and the form of governance outlined in the Europe 2020 Strategy but stresses that its effectiveness will be limited if local and regional authorities only play an implementing role downstream of the decision @-@ making process .
she added that &quot; we should be pleased that Europe 2020 is first putting forward a strategy for overcoming the crisis , followed by guidelines for the future , by building on rather than breaking with the European social model . &quot;
&quot; this is rather disappointing &quot; said Ms Bresso .
the CoR also criticised a lack of specific measures for implementing territorial cohesion : &quot;
the triple objective of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , as well as the seven flagship initiatives , reflect the problems and concerns of local and regional authorities and have the backing of the Committee of the Regions .
measures such as the objective to combat poverty and the changes in the rules on public procurement and state aid are a positive feature of the document .
but if this European strategy is to become a reality , the key question of financial resources needs to be developed further .
speaking on the strategy &apos;s financial dimension , Ms Bresso was keen to stress that the Committee of the Regions would closely monitor the links between the Europe 2020 strategy , cohesion policy and the future EU budget .
in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty , the Committee would also take care to ensure that the draft legislation implementing the strategy was fully compliant with the conditions outlined in the new protocol on subsidiarity .
for all new legislative proposals , added Ms Bresso , it was important to ensure minimum financial or administrative burdens for the EU , national government or local and regional authorities , in proportion to the objectives to be achieved .

the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
the extraordinary meeting of the Committee of the Regions &apos; Bureau , which opened yesterday in Valladolid , concluded today with two discussion sessions that provided an opportunity to review the competitive , connected and greener economic model that was put forward following the recent Copenhagen Summit .
these issues were the focus of statements by Danish CoR member K@@ nu@@ d Andersen , who referred to the Opinion of October 2009 on the Commission White Paper &quot; Adap@@ ting to climate change : towards a European framework for action &quot; and by the Second Vice @-@ President of the Government of Cas@@ tile and León and Minister for the Economy and Employment , Tom@@ ás Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva .
the second session involved a review of the main challenges to the green economy faced with the need for new skills for new jobs .
the chairman of the CoR &apos;s CO@@ TER commission , Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre , also spoke .
a great deal was expected from the new technologies involved in the electric car and he trusted that Europe would provide support , as well as for local coal as part of the policy of ensuring the security of energy supplies , which did not mean excluding nuclear energy .
in practical terms , the decisive commitment to the new sustainable technologies in the automotive sector was one of the cornerstones of the Bureau members &apos; work during their stay in Cas@@ tile and León .
this was the mam@@ mot@@ h task facing elected local and regional politicians .
the bureau of the Committee of the Regions
the Committee of the Regions &apos; Bureau is , broadly speaking , its political driving force .
as a rule , it holds seven meetings a year : one before each of the five plenary sessions held in Brussels and an extraordinary meeting once every six months in the country holding the rotating presidency of the European Union .
among its main tasks , the Bureau is responsible for drawing up the programme of political priorities at the start of each term , supervising its implementation and drafting an assessment report each year and at the end of its term of office .
of the 344 members of the Committee of the Region , 21 are from Spain .
one fact demonstrating Cas@@ tile and León &apos;s commitment to retaining a presence in Europe is that since 2008 , it has provided one of the three Spanish members of the Bureau .
only a few days ago , this leading role was renewed for a further period of two and a half years ; an honour shared by the regions of Extremadura and Asturias .

Europe 2020 : the CoR calls on European regions and cities to join in the debate
&quot; your voice on Europe 2020 &quot; - Today , the CoR launches a Europe @-@ wide consultation , targeted at local and regional authorities , about the proposed Europe 2020 strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
the results gathered through this exercise will feed into the proposals which CoR President Mercedes Bresso will personally present to the President of the European Commission and the EU Presidency .
last week , Mercedes Bresso already voiced her concerns that the EU@@ 2020 strategy does not go far enough in mobilising all the driving forces in EU Member states .
she particularly underlined that the strategy would be much more effective if it enabled local and regional authorities to take an active part in framing national reform programmes and flagship initiatives , rather than simply being limited to implementing them downstream of the decision @-@ making process .
the CoR is convinced that Europe 2020 needs cities and regions if it is to fully achieve its goals .
the consultation questionnaire highlights important issues which are especially relevant to local and regional authorities , and which still remain unanswered in the strategy .
these include , questions about the need for differentiated targets at the territorial level ; the need for indicators going beyond GDP ; the actual role of local and regional authorities in the design and implementation of the new strategy ; the relationships between Europe 2020 , cohesion policy and the EU budget and ; the need to communicate the new strategy to all EU citizens .
more information available online : http : / / port@@ al.@@ cor.europa.eu / europe@@ 2020 /
background :
the European Council is now requested to endorse the strategy &apos;s overall approach and the EU headline targets , and to give its final approval to the strategy .

press Release

Malaga ministerial focuses on Committee of the Regions &apos; EU governance proposals
for the first time in EU history , national ministers in charge of territorial policies dedicated a meeting to multi@@ level governance .
Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) proposals on how to involve cities and regions in European policymaking took centre stage at this informal ministerial meeting organised by the Spanish EU presidency in Malaga today .
Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre ( FR / PES ) , mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k and co @-@ rapporteur of the CoR on multi@@ level governance , joined national ministers to present the requests of Europe &apos;s regional and local authorities .
Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre , who was elected chairman of the Committee of the Regions &apos; Commission for territorial cohesion ( CO@@ TER ) in February , welcomed the initiative taken by the Spanish presidency to organise this first ministerial meeting dedicated to territorial policy and multi@@ level governance issues : &quot;
the moment of truth is near : this will be the territorial expression of the Europe 2020 strategy . &quot;
such an assessment would have helped oil the wheels of the process without creating a disproportionate bureaucratic burden . &quot;
Committee of the Regions proposals on multi@@ level governance
the Spanish presidency had based a large part of its preparatory work for this meeting on the Committee of the Regions &apos; 2009 White Paper on multi@@ level governance .
Del@@ eb@@ arre , who co @-@ au@@ tho@@ red the White Paper with the then CoR President Luc Van den Brande ( BE / EPP ) , presented its main conclusions to the attending ministers .
the White Paper calls for an &quot; EU charter of multi@@ level governance &quot; and requests that all EU proposals should be accompanied by an analysis of their local and regional impact .
it also recommends that each major EU policy reform should include an action plan , setting out the political mechanisms to facilitate the territorial ownership , implementation and evaluation of the policies adopted .
it also suggests the creation of European &quot; territorial p@@ acts &quot; between the different competent levels of government in order to jointly implement the major political priorities and objectives of the European Union in partnership with local and regional authorities .
better cooperation will improve decision @-@ making process , not over@@ complicate it
Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre underlined that such closer cooperation between the local , regional , national and EU levels will strengthen the decision @-@ making process and lead to better laws .
he concluded that : &quot;
multi@@ level governance must lead to political and institutional cooperation at multiple levels .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
EU &quot; macro @-@ regional &quot; strategies define priority projects for groups of regions or countries like the Baltic Sea region or the Danube area .
a high @-@ level conference organised by the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) in Brussels today was the first opportunity to link these separate geographical debates and examine the new concept as a whole .
EU Commissioner for Regional Policy Johannes Hahn joined more than 300 politicians and experts to debate the potential and limitations of existing and emerging macro @-@ regional strategies .
after the adoption of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region in October 2009 , the European Commission is expected to propose a &quot; Danube Strategy &quot; blueprint by the end of this year , as prompted by the Committee of the Regions .
the strategies are considered to be first two test cases for the macro @-@ regional approach , which aims to set priorities for large European regions at EU level and define concrete actions for cross @-@ border cooperation .
the goal is to channel existing resources more effectively in order to improve , for instance , transport and energy networks or to tackle pollution , social development , immigration issues or security policy .
today &apos;s Committee of the Regions event was the first occasion to discuss the added @-@ value of the macro @-@ regional framework across the different regions of Europe .
Ramón Luis Val@@ cár@@ cel Sis@@ o ( ES / EPP ) , First Vice @-@ President of the Committee of the Regions and President of the Autonomous Community of Murcia , welcomed the &quot; added value &quot; of a territorial approach whilst stressing the need to involve regional authorities from the very beginning in the development of a macro @-@ region .
he also called for a broader debate to avoid a &quot; two @-@ speed Europe &quot; where parts of the continent benefit from macro @-@ regional approaches and others don &apos;t , referring in particular to the Mediterranean basin .
Johannes Hahn , European Commissioner for Regional Policy , commented : &quot;
an integrated approach , with coordination of actions across policy areas will achieve better results than individual initiatives .
where groups of countries and regions choose to come together to achieve common goals , this will also strengthen EU cohesion . &quot;
April plenary session to adopt Baltic Sea Strategy report
in her draft opinion , the Member of the Executive Board of Lai@@ tila City Council calls upon the Commission to recognise the central role and capabilities of regional and local level players in implementing the strategy .
in her view , the regional and local level should be given a key position when identifying and selecting coordinating bodies at the level of priority areas and lead partners for flagship projects .
members of the Committee of the Regions have demonstrated their political commitment by forming &quot; inter@@ groups &quot; in order to facilitate discussions on specific macro @-@ regional strategies .
aiming at their coordinated development across Europe , the CoR will take forward the overall debate on macro ‑ regional strategies within its Commission for Territorial Cohesion ( CO@@ TER ) .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
the EU accession process of Croatia , Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was high on the CoR agenda yesterday evening .
after hearing from Štefan Füle , Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood Policy , the CoR adopted its opinion on enlargement strategy and the main challenges for the candidate countries tabled by rapporteur Georgios Pap@@ aster@@ gi@@ ou , Pre@@ fect of Pi@@ eria ( EL / EPP ) .
the debate among CoR members focused in particular on the progress made by Turkey and the relations between Turkey and Greece .
&quot; the decision on EU accession of a country can only be made on the basis of a sound assessment of the reality on the ground and not only by screening the transposition of EU law into national law &quot; underlined CoR rapporteur Georgios Pap@@ aster@@ gi@@ ou .
speaking for the first time in front of the EU assembly of local and regional representatives , Commissioner Füle echoed the Committee &apos;s demands : &quot;
establishing subsidiarity and high quality public administration at all levels is a key pre @-@ requisite for EU membership .
local and regional authorities must be well prepared to fulfil the obligations arising from EU accession .
this is the only way a new Member State can fully benefit from the opportunities EU membership offers . &quot;
Füle gave a brief overview of where the European Commission stands with regard to candidate countries .
&quot; as Commissioner responsible for enlargement , it is my job to make sure countries are fully prepared for membership at the moment they join .
countries will join when they are ready , each based on its own merits .
there will be no free @-@ rides nor any short @-@ cuts . &quot;
he added &quot; We are first and foremost interested in the quality of the accession process , so that with each new accession the Union will be not only grow larger but also stronger . &quot;
expressing the position of the PES Group , its President , Karl @-@ Heinz Klä@@ r , Secretary of State of the German Federal Land of Rhineland @-@ Palatinate , reaffirmed the Group &apos;s strong support to the 2009 @-@ 2010 UE Enlargement Strategy and welcomed the progress made in each of the candidate countries to the EU accession : FYROM , Croatia and Turkey .
&quot; the Copenhagen criteria are the main points of reference for the EU enlargement process &quot; he recalled and underlined the importance of a constructive and forward looking dialogue within the existing international structures aiming at reinforcing cooperation between all parts .
the opinion gives a frank evaluation of the progress made by each candidate country .
read the speech given by Commissioner Füle .
detailed country analyses and the CoR &apos;s political requests to the candidate countries can be found in the draft opinion and the tabled amendments .

CoR / 10 / 36
Committee of the Regions presents outline for cohesion policy reform
50 billion Euros a year are at stake in the forthcoming reform of EU regional policy .
to make sure that the requests of regions and cities are taken on board at an early stage , the Committee of the Regions today presented its outline for the future of EU cohesion policy after 2013 .
following a plenary debate with Johannes Hahn , European Commissioner for Regional Policy , local and regional politicians adopted an outlook opinion drafted by Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) .
the opinion urges EU partners and national governments to retain an ambitious cohesion policy as a &quot; core element &quot; of the European integration model .
following extensive consultations , Michael Schneider , State Secretary of the German Land of Saxony @-@ Anhalt , prepared a draft outlook opinion on the future of cohesion policy .
the amended opinion was adopted at the Committee of the Regions plenary session today , making it the first EU body to formulate an official position on the issue .
Michael Schneider commented : &quot;
the long @-@ term nature of European support should give all regions the security to press ahead with development and enable them to respond to their own particular situations without the fear that funding may be capped .
referring in particular to the so @-@ called &apos; transition regions &apos; where future funding is in jeopardy , he added : &quot;
regions in transition need special consideration .
aid to regions which will no longer be covered by the convergence objective should be guaranteed independently of the future architecture of regional policy and its various objectives . &quot;
addressing the Committee of the Regions plenary session for the first time , EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn , said : &quot;
we are united by a common interest , strengthening the regional and local level .
if we want to make Europe visible , we can do this best through a strong regional policy .
what we need is a good balance between focusing on selected core priorities and maximum flexibility for tailor @-@ made implementation of these priorities in the regions . &quot;
welcoming Commissioner Hahn &apos;s commitment to cooperation with the Committee of the Regions , Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre ( FR / PES ) , Mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k and Chairman of the CoR &apos;s Commission for territorial cohesion , emphasised : &quot;
Commissioner , you have a struggle ahead of you in the College of Commissioners , where some of your colleagues are not necessarily allies of cohesion policy .
it is up to you to raise awareness of the territorial effects that other EU policies have .
cohesion policy can not be expected to repair the damage done by other EU policies . &quot;
key points of the Committee of the Regions outlook opinion
the EU &apos;s regional and local representatives believe that cohesion policy must evolve with the aim of continuing in the future to narrow development gaps sustainably , strengthen sustainable growth and employment in European regions , support social inclusion and competitiveness in all the Member States and regions , safeguard subsidiarity and ensure financial sustainability .
thanks to the system of multi @-@ level governance , Europe is able to pursue common objectives while at the same time leaving due scope for establishing specific regional and local priorities .
the Committee of the Regions feels that this - in addition to financial solidarity - represents the added value of cohesion policy .
the members of the Committee of the Regions further agree that cohesion policy should continue to be applied to all of Europe &apos;s regions , focusing in particular on the regions in greatest need .
the major share of available resources must continue to go to the ne@@ e@@ diest and most problem @-@ ridden Member States and regions .
furthermore , regions in transition need special support so that the successes they have achieved are not jeopardised by the funding being discontinued .
the &apos; competitiveness and employment &apos; objective must also continue to support all the other EU regions , not least in order to boost innovation , social cohesion and competitiveness .
the Committee of the Regions emphasises that the existing support for cross @-@ border , transnational and inter @-@ regional cooperation has proved successful and should be continued and be@@ ef@@ ed up beyond 2013 .
in order to reduce red tape in cohesion policy , the Committee sees no need to conduct a full compliance audit in each funding period .
instead , the established rules in place for national funding should be deemed sufficient .
the current principles of cohesion policy with respect to the system of multi@@ level governance , multiannual programme planning , partnership , focusing of effort , indicator @-@ based programme management and assessment , have proved successful .
the Committee of the Regions therefore rejects any shortening of the timeframe of the seven @-@ year programme .
the subsidiarity @-@ based approach must be retained and further expanded .
to this end , it is above all important to further strengthen the role of local and regional authorities at every stage of the programming , implementation and assessment of cohesion policy .
the consolidated outlook opinion will be available on the CoR website soon .

Michel Plat@@ ini : football and local authorities working together will score on social inclusion
this was the message of Michel Plat@@ ini , President of UEFA , speaking at the Committee of the Regions Plenary Session in Brussels on Wednesday .
&quot; the European sporting model ... relies heavily on the support of local communities at every level , and especially at the amateur level . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , football is a far more effective driver of integration than school or social services , and it is football which gives young people their identities . &quot;
this view of sport as a force for change was shared by Ram@@ on Luis Val@@ car@@ cel Sis@@ o ( ES / EPP ) , President of the Autonomous Community of Murcia First and Vice @-@ President of the CoR , who chaired the Plenary .
the EU has understood that sport can also play a role in the creation of truly European identity . &quot;
meanwhile , Dimitrios K@@ alo@@ ger@@ opoulos , Mayor of E@@ gal@@ eo , Athens ( EL / EPP ) , made the link between a healthy population and an economically productive one : &quot;
as the former President of E@@ gal@@ eo football team , I am convinced that a strong , healthy population constitutes the necessary basis and driving force for economic growth , competitiveness and greater prosperity in Europe . &quot;
Jean@@ ette Arnold ( UK / PES ) , a member of the London Assembly and representing the city which will take on the Olympic man@@ tle in 2012 , agreed that sport was a powerful tool for integration .
&quot; the success of schemes like Ki@@ ck@@ z , which offers young people across the UK the opportunity to train in football or engage in other sporting and cultural activities , lies in the great gift that sport has to inspire young people to exploit their talents , take up new challenges and build strong ties in the community . &quot;
&quot; the weaknesses of football &apos;s economic model have been exposed by the crisis .
many privately owned clubs have been forced to ask for financial support from their local authorities to avoid bankruptcy .
is this the most effective use of taxpayers &apos; money ? &quot;
Peter Moore ( UK / ALDE ) , member of Sheffield City Council and CoR rapporteur on equality in sport in 2007 , stressed the need for football clubs to give something back to the communities that support them through thick and thin .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
have your say on cross @-@ border cooperation in Europe !
the Committee of the Regions today launched a Europe @-@ wide consultation of regions and cities on EU rules for cross @-@ border cooperation .
organised jointly with the European Commission , the EU Council presidency &quot; trio &quot; and the Interact Programme , the consultation formally kicked off with a conference in Cá@@ cer@@ es , Spain .
its results will feed into the review of the relevant EU legislation , which is scheduled for 2011 .
following an initiative of the Committee of the Regions , since 2006 the European Union has made available to local and regional authorities a purpose @-@ built tool for cross @-@ border cooperation : the so @-@ called &apos; European Grou@@ ping of Territorial Cooperation &apos; , or EG@@ TC .
regions and cities wishing to develop joint projects can set up such EG@@ T@@ Cs without major administrative barriers or approval procedures by national capitals .
on the basis of a solid organisation with legal personality , they can apply for any kind of EU or national funding and combine it with private funding in public @-@ private @-@ partnerships .
the forthcoming review of the EG@@ CT regulation presents a window of opportunity to improve the concept even further in view of local experiences .
the consultation questionnaire is targeted at EU member states , EG@@ T@@ Cs already set up or under preparation , local and regional authorities and other stakeholders .
it focuses mainly on the lessons learned so far and the legal questions that the review should address .
the questionnaire also aims at identifying the concrete added value and the future potential of the EG@@ T@@ Cs .
the results will be presented in Brussels during the OPEN DAYS in October , and will feed into the Committee of the Regions &apos; own @-@ initiative opinion on the review of the EG@@ TC regulation .
prepared by Alberto N@@ ú@@ ñ@@ ez Fei@@ j@@ ó@@ o ( ES / EPP ) , President of the Autonomous Community of Galicia , this opinion is scheduled for adoption by the Committee of the Regions plenary in early 2011 .
background :
developing cross @-@ border projects at the regional and local levels used to be a difficult and lengthy process , as they often involved the negotiation of bilateral state treaties by national governments .
in 2002 , the Committee of the Regions had therefore urged the other EU institutions to create a stable legal framework for cross @-@ border cooperation in Europe .
following intense CoR campaigning , the EU regulation establishing the European Grou@@ ping of Territorial Cooperation ( EG@@ TC ) was finally adopted in July 2006 .
Europe &apos;s regional and local authorities have set up 13 EG@@ T@@ Cs so far , with many more in the pipeline .
for instance , the new cooperation model paved the way for Europe &apos;s first jointly managed hospital on the Franco @-@ Spanish border in the Pyrenees .
a list of existing and planned EG@@ T@@ Cs is available at the CoR website .

a new initiative from the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) will help signatories of the Covenant of Mayors turn their commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions into a concrete reality , as local leaders push ahead with plans to tackle climate change despite the failure of Copenhagen .
we have today launched a survey on sustainable energy policies in regions and cities as the first phase of our initiative to collect and disseminate best practice in tackling climate change .
I invite all signatories of the Covenant of Mayors , and all local and regional authorities , to participate .
building on the expertise of its Europe@@ 2020 Monitoring Platform , enlarged to include contributions from Covenant of Mayors members , the CoR will compile a unique database of action being carried out at the local level to combat global warming .
the data will then be shared with all the members of the platform and Covenant of Mayors signatories to allow them to learn from their peers about how best to meet their obligations to cut emissions .
the results will also form part of the Committee of the Regions &apos; contributions to the new EU Energy Action Plan , which will set the framework for European energy policy to 2020 , and to the special session of the European Council devoted to energy policy in May 2011 .
that is why the role of regions as supporting structures within the Covenant of Mayors is so important .
the CoR will also continue to play its part in defining the role of local and regional authorities in the wider EU efforts to protect the environment .
the survey , in all languages , can be found on the website of the Europe 2020 Monitoring Platform

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
European neighbourhood policy and enlargement : how will the Commission ensure that local and regional authorities in the countries concerned are not sidel@@ ined ?
the CoR would propose several measures which the commissioner @-@ designate could take to ensure this .
how can the European Commission increase the participation of candidate and potential candidate countries &apos; local and regional authorities throughout the EU accession process ?
the Committee of the Regions has constantly pointed out in its opinions on the enlargement package that candidate and potential candidate countries &apos; local and regional authorities have been sidel@@ ined from the enlargement process .
the CoR therefore calls for future Commission enlargement reports on individual countries to look at decentralisation , in accordance with European standards , and the progress made by local authorities from the candidate countries .
the CoR expects to be considered as a partner by the European Commission in assessing implementation of the Copenhagen criteria by the countries concerned and by their local and regional authorities .
but this contact should not be limited to the national level .
the CoR therefore invites the future commissioner to support and take part in the first meeting of its EU @-@ Croatia Joint Consultative Committee , which will take place in spring 2010 .
how does the Commission intend to consolidate the Council &apos;s political initiatives and the role of local and regional authorities as recognised by the Council ?
with both the Union for the Mediterranean ( U@@ f@@ M ) and the Eastern Partnership , the Council laid the foundations for renewed political dialogue with the EU &apos;s partner countries .
the role of local and regional authorities was then recognised and appreciated by successive EU presidencies , with the CoR involved in meetings and other work in this area .
a similar approach is proposed for the Eastern Partnership , with the support of the Commission .
the CoR thus calls on the Commission to take a multi@@ level approach to these - and other - initiatives , so that local and regional authorities can play their due role in European neighbourhood policy .
note to editors :
the CoR &apos;s position and proposals on the major EU policies are set out in the document &quot; Building Europe in partnership &quot; ;
Eastern Partnership : the CoR calls for a &quot; territorial &quot; approach and is laying the groundwork for the establishment of a &quot; local and regional assembly of Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus &quot; - see press release .

the Committee of the Regions has marked European Maritime Day with a call for a fundamental change in the way maritime issues are coordinated within the EU and on the global stage to safeguard and protect the environmental , economic , biological and cultural wealth of Europe &apos;s seas .
speaking at the EM@@ D event in Gi@@ jon , Spain , CoR First Vice @-@ President Ramón Luis Val@@ cár@@ cel Sis@@ o ( EPP / ES ) said : &quot;
the aim of EU maritime policy is to recognise and preserve the richness of Europe &apos;s seas .
to achieve this , an innovative approach is needed , involving national , regional and local governments both from within and outside the EU .
Val@@ cár@@ cel stressed that regions had a key role to play in developing this new approach , highlighting the work of Brittany , whose coastal charter has been praised by the European Commission as a prime example of how an integrated maritime strategy should work .
he also called on coastal regions to take advantage of the opportunities provided by European Grou@@ ping of Territorial Cooperation ( EG@@ TC ) legislation to work more closely with each other on tackling maritime issues .
also taking part in the Gi@@ jon event was Michael Cohen ( PES / MT ) , the CoR &apos;s rapporteur on proposals for an integrated maritime strategy for the Mediterranean , whose geopolitical situation means that cooperation between EU and non @-@ EU states in tackling maritime issues is even more important .
the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Local and Regional Assembly ( AR@@ LE@@ M ) should also be supported more widely in this field . &quot;

the social crisis warrants as much political commitment as the banking crisis
the EU &apos;s territorial cohesion and public confidence in European integration are both at stake .
the adoption of a resolution on the &quot; Broad economic and employment guidelines 2010 &quot; will echo these concerns and underline the call from regions and local authorities for rigorous efforts by every level of government to ensure that the impact of the economic crisis on public finances does not lead to a social crisis , which could have devastating repercussions .
in other words , what is needed is the same political deci@@ siveness that was shown in the bailout of banks last year .
Michel Barnier , European Commissioner for the Internal Market , will present local and regional elected representatives with the Commission &apos;s analysis and the approach it plans to adopt .
the political links and coordination between the EU &apos;s regional and agricultural policies and in particular the future development of Europe &apos;s rural areas will be the second major debate dominating the June plenary session .
in April , EU agriculture Commissioner Dacian Cioloş called on the CoR to put forward its proposals on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy .

press Release
regions and cities warn Member states that Europe 2020 does not have the means to deliver on its promises
the overwhelming majority of the cities and regions that responded to the consultation conducted by the CoR this spring believe that the Europe 2020 project , as it stands , does not have the means to deliver on its promises .
contributors also criticise the lack of time for a well coordinated decision taken by all levels of government and other stakeholders to ensure an effective implementation of the strategy .
the CoR &apos;s First Vice @-@ president , Ramón Luis Val@@ cár@@ cel Sis@@ o , voiced these concerns in a letter sent yesterday to EU Heads of State and Government , as well as Presidents of EU institutions .
in their responses to the public consultation launched last April by the CoR , regional and local authorities have expressed doubts over the EU@@ 2020 strategy &apos;s policy actions and tools , its lack of flexibility in adapting to variable territorial conditions , and its proposed governance and funding channels .
they are deeply concerned that Europe 2020 does not take into account existing socio @-@ economic disparities and the uneven distribution of opportunities between and within regions and cities .
some key decisions , like target setting at EU and country levels , appear to have been made so far in a hasty , top @-@ down manner .
contributors warned EU institutions that without their involvement there could be no ownership outside Brussels , and that a joint commitment from all tiers of government all over Europe remains crucial to the success of Europe 2020 .
the CoR &apos;s First Vice President asked the European Council to invite all Member States to activate existing institutional tools in order to involve their regions and cities in their countries &apos; contributions to the EU targets and flagship initiatives as well as in the draft National Reform Programmes .
he pointed out that this would be better achieved by re@@ scheduling the roadmap for Europe 2020 to allow more time for key decisions to be taken by all the relevant partners .
he also announced the CoR &apos;s intention to monitor progress on the ground by means of its Monitoring Platform , and report regularly to the EU institutions .
the &quot; Key Fin@@ dings , Assessment and Policy Imp@@ lic@@ ations &quot; of the consultation results can be found on the CoR website .
1. its objectives , indicators and targets should be flexibly adapted to existing socio @-@ economic differences and disparities between regions and territories ;
2. a new set of indicators , complementing GDP with broader measures of sustainability and quality of life , should be used as a policy tool to stimulate growth , mobilising local resources ;
3. the Flag@@ ship Initiatives should be used as an opportunity to focus existing EU funding instruments on a limited number of priorities , overcoming the present fragmentation ;
6. it should be seen as complementary and mutually reinforcing with a strengthened cohesion policy for all EU territory .
the CoR will carry on monitoring progress on the ground , by means of its Europe 2020 Monitoring Platform , as requested by the European Parliament , and will report regularly to the Council , the European Commission and the European Parliament .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
CoR tells Cioloş : future CAP must be fairer , focused and fit @-@ for @-@ purpose
the opinion , drafted by René Sou@@ chon ( FR / PES ) , President of the Auvergne regional council and a former French agriculture minister , is the CoR &apos;s response to the call by EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Cioloş for input from local and regional actors on the future of one of the EU &apos;s most controversial and expensive policies .
in his opinion , Sou@@ chon sets out a number of red lines which he believes must not be crossed .
&quot; first , it is clear that the CAP should remain an EU policy : the Committee of the Regions will resist any attempt to renation@@ alise farm expenditure , as has been called for by some Member States .
second , we need to establish what we consider the goals of the CAP before setting its budget - and not limit our aims to what can be achieved by the money available .
Sou@@ chon also calls on the European Commission to ensure greater coordination between the CAP and cohesion policy in the area of rural development .
his initial proposal to transfer the non @-@ agricultural measures from the second &quot; pillar &quot; of the CAP to cohesion policy was considered too radical by the CoR Plenary .
but the Committee nonetheless agreed that it was important to clarify the situation with regard to support for non @-@ agricultural rural activities , to ensure that rural communities across the EU get the support they need .
responding to this key demand , Commissioner Cioloş reassured the CoR that &quot; both Commissioner Hahn and myself will work to remove the grey areas in order to ensure better coordination between cohesion policy and the CAP .
our aim is to improve the relationship between urban and rural areas and the social and environmental challenges they face . &quot;
Sou@@ chon concluded : &quot;

Europe 2030 : Europe &apos;s leadership needs a new compact between the national , regional and local authorities
in its report to the European Council , the Ref@@ lection Group emphasises that partnership and public support will be crucial to carrying out the reforms needed to tackle the current economic and social crisis .
the Group has thus responded to a call made by the CoR which , in its June 2009 White paper on Multi@@ level Governance , stated that &quot; multi @-@ level governance is a method and a solution , aimed at establishing a more innovative , flexible and inclusive dynamic able to reconcile the Europe of citizens and the EU &apos;s management of global challenges . &quot;
during the Bureau meeting , the two co ‑ rapporteurs for the White Paper , Luc Van den Brande , chairman of the CI@@ V@@ EX Commission , and Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre , chairman of the CO@@ TER Commission , warmly welcomed the report , which envisages a &apos; system of multi @-@ level governance , where competences are shared - rather than split . &quot;
they pointed out that &quot; From now on , the Europe 2020 Strategy , the fight against climate change , the recast of the EU budget , the relaunch of the internal market and the anticipated reforms of cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy should be planned and implemented in partnership with regional and local authorities . &quot;
local and regional authorities will shoulder their responsibilities for European integration , especially when preparing and implementing these reforms .
the CoR also shares the Group &apos;s view that &quot; Europeans will need a highly competitive and sustainable social market economy in order to maintain social cohesion and fight against climate change . &quot;
Mr Val@@ cár@@ cel pointed out that the CoR had repeatedly highlighted the urgent need to establish economic governance in the EU and to strengthen the sense of belonging via the civic and public services provided by local and regional authorities , from which everyone benefits .

press release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
for the Citizens &apos; Initiative to be understood and taken on board by those most concerned by it , i.e. ordinary Europeans , it has to be as clear as possible .
recognising the vitality of local and regional democracy in Europe , both the Council and the European Parliament have asked the Committee of the Regions for its opinion on the best way of implementing this Initiative , introduced under the Treaty of Lisbon .
fearing that the complexities of the procedure will prevent people from using it , the Committee is calling for a relaxation of the requirements for introducing a Citizens &apos; Initiative .
S@@ onia Mas@@ ini , President of the Province of Reggio Emilia ( IT / PES ) , who drew up the Committee &apos;s Opinion , dis@@ agrees with the Commission proposal here , considering that the &quot; significant number &quot; of countries required to support the initiative should be one quarter - rather than one third - of Member States .
&quot; the threshold being proposed is too high and will not encourage this new right of Europeans to participate in the EU &apos;s democratic process to take root .
the CoR would like the European Commission to provide a framework which reflects the potential of this new instrument .
and my views on this are shared by a good many MEPs , &quot; she says .
she stresses that translation is particularly important for ensuring that initiatives are not hampered by language barriers .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
the Committee of the Regions &apos; message is clear : since the financial management of these sites falls mainly to the local and regional authorities , it is incomprehensible that the current Commission proposals foresee no role for them in this process .
Mi@@ re@@ ille Lac@@ om@@ be ( FR / PES ) , Member of Pu@@ y @-@ de @-@ D@@ ôme General Council and rapporteur on the label , stressed this point at the Committee &apos;s plenary session in Brussels .
the new label is expected to come into force no later than 2012 .
its aim is to showcase sites that symboli@@ se European integration .
the Commission &apos;s proposals draw on a project launched in 2006 by several countries , without the involvement of the European institutions .
thus , in the new framework , Member States would pre @-@ select sites to be awarded the label by a European panel .
&quot; when I heard that the EU intended to establish a &quot; European Heritage Label &quot; stated Mi@@ re@@ ille Lac@@ om@@ be &quot; I applauded this excellent initiative . &quot;
nevertheless , she criticised the European Commission for failing to foresee a role in this labelling process for local and regional authorities or for the Committee of the Regions , their voice at the European level , despite knowing that these authorities have primary responsibility for these sites .
&quot; European regional and local representatives are calling to be included in the national pre @-@ selection process and for the Committee of the Regions to participate in the final selection by appointing a member of the European panel - as is the case for the European capital of culture &quot; confirmed Mi@@ re@@ ille Lac@@ om@@ be .
in its opinion , the CoR also regrets that the initiative is only open to EU Member States , whereas the intergovernmental initiative behind the label included Switzerland , and candidate countries can join in the European capital of culture initiative .
why not extend the label to EU neighbouring countries and allow them to manage and protect Europe &apos;s cultural heritage ? &quot;
background :
the original &quot; European Heritage Label &quot; concept was launched in April 2006 by several European countries , without the official involvement of the EU institutions .
to date , 64 sites in 16 EU countries and Switzerland have been awarded the label .
in France , this label has been awarded to the Abbey of Cl@@ un@@ y , the Robert Schuman House near Metz , and the Courtyard of Hon@@ our of the Pop@@ es &apos; Palace in Avignon .
in November 2008 , in order to improve the functioning of the label , the Member States asked the European Commission to turn it into an official initiative , based on the &quot; European capital of culture &quot; model .
in March 2010 , the Commission presented its proposals to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament , so that they could reach a decision together .
the label differs from other cultural heritage initiatives , such as the UNESCO world heritage initiative or the Council of Europe Cultural Rou@@ tes in several ways :
it is awarded to sites that have played a vital role in the history of the European Union ,
it selects sites on the basis of their symbolic value rather than their beauty or architectural quality , and
it emphasises the educational aspects , especially for young people .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
van den Brande reminds Barnier of need to work hand in hand with local and regional authorities on key issue of services
&quot; the Lisbon Treaty brought many new developments for the Committee of the Regions , including an extension of the policy areas in which the CoR must be consulted to include services of general interest .
since these public and social services are in large part supplied at the local and regional level , it is right that the CoR should be consulted on any proposed changes to the way in which they are regulated at the EU level .
but it also recognises the need for greater certainty over how the provision of SS@@ GI is compatible with EU law , in particular the rules governing the internal market .
&quot; all too often , in the absence of legal certainty in relation to SS@@ GI , the latter tend to fall under the general competition and internal market rules , which may not be appropriate for the specific missions delegated to them by the local and regional authorities , &quot;
the opinion states .
&quot; this legal uncertainty became clear during the debate on whether they should be covered by the proposal for a directive on services in the internal market and led to their being excluded from its sphere of application . &quot;
President Van den Brande added : &quot;
in his responses to MEPs , Michel Barnier made it clear that he is committed to working more closely with the European Parliament and the European Council under the terms of the new Lisbon Treaty .
we expect that this spirit of enhanced cooperation will also be extended to the CoR , an institution that Commissioner @-@ designate Barnier knows well from his time as regional policy commissioner in the Prodi Commission . &quot;
Barnier was one of the Committee &apos;s key allies in its bid to enshr@@ ine the principle of territorial cohesion within the Lisbon treaty and to increase its powers as Europe &apos;s subsidiarity &quot; watch@@ dog &quot; with the power to protect local and regional competences .
&quot; knowing his conviction , we have reason to hope that Barnier will do more than simply listen - even more so as the Lisbon Treaty gives the CoR new powers to ensure that its opinions are acted upon .

press release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
with one in six Europeans claiming that they find it difficult to pay household bills according to a new Eurobarometer survey , the CoR has been quick to speak out against the social repercussions of the crisis .
losing their home places people at extreme risk of poverty .
that is why the CoR is calling on the European Commission to put forward targeted proposals to support local and regional authorities in their daily fight against hom@@ elessness .
Europe needs to go beyond statements of intent during the European year for combating poverty and demonstrate its ability and will to help the weakest members of society .
hom@@ elessness is a problem which European regions and cities all face , one which knows no borders and which is a heavy financial burden for local and regional authorities .
that is why the CoR is calling for concerted action at European level and , instead of waiting to be consulted by the European Commission , has decided to take the step of making its voice heard .
&quot; with the proliferation of precarious situations caused by the current crisis , we expect more and more of our co @-@ citizens to face the risk of social exclusion .
this in turn can quickly lead to loss of housing and descent into extreme poverty .
this year , more than ever , the European Union must seize the bull by the horns &quot; the rapporteur said .
one major deficiency at the moment is the lack of reliable , official statistical data .
&quot; without such information it will be difficult to frame the economic and social strategies that are needed to address hom@@ elessness and guarantee the effectiveness of the strategies .
that is why the proposed measures are often based on thin research findings and tend to be political in nature . &quot;
several Member States have adopted national or local strategies which have helped to improve the coordination of policies against social exclusion at their level .
however , the CoR rapporteur believes that the European institutions need to go beyond their traditional coordinating role and &quot; be more active in supporting progress and monitoring measures taken .
more resources should be earmarked for training when planning for the next Structural Fund period . &quot;
this approach has been endorsed by the European Federation of National Organisations working with the Hom@@ eless ( FE@@ ANT@@ SA ) together with which the CoR sponsors the HAB@@ IT@@ ACT network which brings together cities which are at the forefront of efforts to tackle extreme poverty .

Committee of the Regions gears up for cohesion reform and urges more support for interregional cooperation
local and regional politicians from across Europe sent a strong message in favour of maintaining an ambitious EU cohesion policy after 2013 , when its current design and funding expires .
meeting in Ja@@ én , Spain , today , the members of the Committee of the Regions &apos; Commission for territorial cohesion ( CO@@ TER ) emphasised the positive knock @-@ on effects of such funding for regional growth and social inclusion .
at the same time , they urged reforms to improve its strategic planning and evaluation and called upon the European Commission to step up its support for interregional cooperation .
within the framework of the Spanish Presidency , the Committee of the Regions had been invited to Ja@@ én at the initiative of Lu@@ c@@ ena Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ ero , Secretary General for External Affairs of Andalucía , to debate the future of cohesion policy after the Lisbon treaty .
summ@@ arising today &apos;s discussions , Marek Wo@@ ź@@ ni@@ ak ( PL / EPP ) , Marshall of the Wielkopol@@ skie region and First Vice Chair of the CO@@ TER Commission , underlined : &quot;
we therefore emphasise the need for continuing this policy at European level , based on the values of solidarity , and ambitious in both objectives and funding . &quot;
María del Mar Moreno , Regional Minister of the Presidency for the Andalu@@ c@@ ían government , said : &quot;
only such a transition system would avoid endangering the results achieved by cohesion policy in regions such as Andalucía . &quot;
CoR members agreed on the need to improve strategic planning in cohesion policy and to introduce more effective tools for assessing its results .
any reform must also be in line with the EU &apos;s new objective of &quot; territorial cohesion , &quot; seminar participants insisted .
this means that the European institutions have to pay more attention to the regional impact of all EU activities from the outset .
the seminar also concluded that cohesion policy should contribute to the new &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy , while retaining its own objectives as set out in the EU treaty .
addressing the concrete needs of regions all over Europe , the CoR called on the European Commission to step up support for European Group@@ ings for Territorial Cooperation ( EG@@ TC ) , a new EU instrument for regions to carry out interregional cooperation .
the Committee also urged the Commission to define more precisely the role of so @-@ called macro @-@ regions in the framework of EU cohesion policy .
CoR bra@@ ces itself for cohesion policy negotiations
the current EU budget and programmes are set until 2013 , but important decisions determining eligibility rules and funding levels for the future European cohesion policy are expected within the next year .
having unanimously adopted the outlook opinion prepared by Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) , European affairs state secretary in Saxony @-@ Anhalt , in April , the Committee of the Regions is the first EU body with an official position on the future of cohesion policy .
to further clarify the relationship between cohesion policy and the &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy , the incoming Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union has asked the Committee of the Regions for an opinion on the issue .
Michael Schneider is currently drafting this opinion , which is scheduled for adoption in October .
Constan@@ tin Ost@@ af@@ ici@@ u@@ c ( RO / EPP ) , President of Tim@@ i@@ ş County Council , is meanwhile preparing the Committee &apos;s response to the European Commission &apos;s recent strategic report on the implementation of the cohesion policy programmes 2007 @-@ 2013 .

Commission President Barroso meets CoR President Bresso and regional and local leaders
to feed the requests of regions and cities into key EU reform debates , Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) President Mercedes Bresso brought together Commission President Barroso and the Presidents of European associations of regional and local authorities .
meeting in Brussels today , the regional and local leaders urged the European Commission to acknowledge the Lisbon Treaty &apos; upgrade &apos; for regions and cities in the discussions on the Europe 2020 strategy , cohesion policy and the future EU budget .
the leaders underlined that their support of future European Commission proposals will depend on the European executive &apos;s readiness to put the territorial approach of EU proposals centre stage .
the Europe 2020 strategy or the EU budget reform can only be successful if developed and implemented via a multi @-@ level governance approach where all government levels share ownership and responsibility .
regions and local authorities call for a coherent implementation of the principle of territorial cohesion , enshrined in the Treaty , which requires better coordination among all levels of government .
territorial cohesion is not only a goal , it has to become the guiding principle for implementing all EU policies .
regarding the future EU budget reform , local and regional leaders called upon the European Commission to acknowledge that an integrated and territorial approach has been shown the most effective .
the crisis should trigger a reform of the EU budget which makes it easier to combine EU funds .
while leaders insisted that the EU budget should not be reduced , they asked for a thorough revision as regards its delivery provisions which , due to their bureaucracy , often hamper the efficient use of EU funds .
speaking ahead of the meeting Commission President José Manuel Barroso said : &quot;
I am very pleased to meet , together with the President of the Committee of the Regions , Mercedes Bresso , the representatives of the regions and cities of Europe .
together we will be able to put the European Union on the necessary path to fiscal consolidation and structural reform that will help us in ensuring sustainable growth and jobs in Europe .
I am looking forward to a fruitful dialogue and I count on the close involvement of regions and cities in the implementation of our Europe 2020 strategy . &quot;
however , regions and local authorities expect from President Barroso that the European Commission thinks about the territorial impact whenever it drafts new legislation , cultiv@@ ates a steady dialogue with those who implement EU legislation on the ground and cuts red tape wherever possible to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens . &quot;
President Barroso also announced his intention to continue the debate with the Committee of the Regions at the OPEN DAYS in October and at its December plenary session .

press Release
Bresso calls for &apos; coalition &apos; against potential breach of subsidiarity rules
the European Commission &apos;s recent proposals to impose sanctions on countries with excessive deficits could be in breach of the EU &apos;s subsidiarity principle , Mercedes Bresso , President of the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) , told the Extremadura regional parliament in Méri@@ da , Spain , on Friday .
she called on all regional and national governments to form a &quot; coalition &quot; with the CoR to defend the subsidiarity principle , if necessary before the Court of Justice .
President Bresso said that the Commission &apos;s communication on economic governance published earlier this month had sounded the alarm bells because one of the key sanctions proposed on member states with excessive deficits would be the suspension of funding linked to cohesion , agriculture or fisheries policies .
she explained that it should be seen by regional parliaments as a complementary way to make their voice heard , in addition to the early warning mechanism outlined in the Treaty .
Juan Ramón Ferreira Díaz , president of the Extremadura regional assembly , said : &quot;
the treaty of Lisbon recognises the principle of subsidiarity and establishes mechanisms for its implementation and defence , giving the CoR a key role .
we are convinced that you will use your new authority wisely , and we will continue to collaborate with you to build a strong Europe and to overcome the current economic crisis . &quot;
he added that the regional assembly would continue to play an active part in the CoR &apos;s subsidiarity monitoring network .
the Lisbon Treaty effectively gave the CoR the role of the defender of subsidiarity , with the right to go directly to the European courts if it believes that a breach has occurred - a responsibility that President Bresso said she would not shir@@ k .
in her inaugural speech as president of the CoR , she said that the Lisbon Treaty would bring new life to the Committee : &quot;
we will no longer just ask that regional and local authorities are taken into consideration .
we will not just be the yes @-@ man .
we will enter the political debate with substantial proposals and we will not - if it is required - shy away from political controversy . &quot;

CoR demands territorial impact assessment for all parts of future CAP
the future development of the Common Agricultural Policy must be based on a thorough assessment of its impact on local communities , Mercedes Bresso , President of the Committee of the Regions , warned on Tuesday .
speaking at the European Commission &apos;s two @-@ day conference on the future of the CAP post @-@ 2013 President Bresso said : &quot;
to guarantee territorial cohesion - set as one of the political objectives of the EU in the Lisbon Treaty - we must strive to ensure that all the EU &apos;s sectoral policies are coherent and complementary .
before considering corrective or compensatory measures , we must anticipate the consequences that the new legislation will have on regions and local communities .
this is why the Committee believes that all major reforms of European policies should be subject to territorial impact studies , including the CAP . &quot;
she also repeated the CoR &apos;s position that there is a need for greater harmonisation between the CAP and cohesion policy in order to maximise their effectiveness .
President Bresso said that the beneficial impact of the CAP on local communities could be substantially improved by adopting a multi @-@ level governance approach .
&quot; regions and rural communities can no longer be mere co @-@ finan@@ cers of programmes - they must be actively involved in the development , implementation and management of those programmes too .
a successful overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy requires across @-@ the @-@ board involvement of the regional or local level . &quot;

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
CoR / 10 / 59
the forthcoming review of the EU budget must not lead to less money for local and regional authorities to invest in sustainable , green and socially fair growth , the Committee of the Regions has warned .
speaking after a debate on the forthcoming EU budget review at the CoR &apos;s external Bureau meeting in Antwerp , the Committee &apos;s President Mercedes Bresso warned that Member States &apos; knee @-@ jer@@ k reaction to the economic downturn must not be allowed to impact front @-@ line services , most of which are supplied at the local or regional level .
&quot; in these tough economic times , it is only natural that EU governments will look to reduce public spending when they review the EU budget .
but the question is where will we cut ?
core policy areas such as social inclusion , sustainable energy use or the Europe 2020 programme will need substantial funding .
everybody knows that European policies can only work if local and regional authorities are on the front @-@ line , delivering real results .
Europe not only has to secure the funding but also strengthen its capacity to implement its policies on the ground .
President Bresso also welcomed the acceptance by European Commission President José Manuel Barroso of one of the key request from the Committee on the EU budget .
&quot; I welcome President Barroso &apos;s reference in his recent &apos; State of the Union &apos; speech to extending the EU budget over 10 years , rather than the current seven , with a mid @-@ term review after five years .
the Committee has long called for such a system , which will give the European institutions greater flexibility in setting EU budget and policy priorities .
in this regard , I also believe that we must consider issuing euro @-@ bonds in order to finance long @-@ term strategic projects . &quot;
Kris Pe@@ eters , Minister @-@ President of Flanders who presented the Belgian Presidency priorities to the Bureau meeting , said : &quot;
it is clear that the Committee of the Regions is important to Flanders , all the more so since it received additional competences as part of the Lisbon Treaty .
this interest in the Committee is part of Flanders &quot; wider priorities , enhancing the Europe@@ an@@ isation and internationalisation of the region and of its six million inhabitants .
using the Europe 2020 strategy as a tool , in synergy with the government &apos;s own Flanders in Action plan , the Flemish authorities intend to turn Flanders into one of the top five most advanced regions in Europe by 2020 . &quot;
the 60 members of the CoR Bureau , its decision @-@ making executive , also used the Antwerp meeting to visit several sustainable energy projects being developed in the city &apos;s port area ahead of a debate on the future EU energy strategy with Flemish environment minister , Jo@@ ke Schau@@ v@@ liege .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
Luc Van den Brande , President of the EU Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) , has called on the Commissioners @-@ designate for energy and climate action to acknowledge the key role played at the local and regional level in reducing energy consumption and tackling the causes and effects of climate change .
speaking ahead of the European Parliament hearings for Günter Oettinger and Connie Hedegaard , President Van den Brande said : &quot;
the failure of national leaders to agree on concrete action to tackle climate change or to set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions has made it clearer than ever that the local and regional level must shoulder a large part of this responsibility .
with many CoR members or the local and regional authorities they represent among the more than 1000 signatories of the pact .
the agreement is expected to be signed in the coming months and will enable the exchange of best practice between mayors on both sides of the Atlantic .
the CoR &apos;s Lisbon Monitoring Platform has also begun a recent consultation in cooperation with the Covenant of Mayors aimed at establishing a comprehensive database of climate action at the local and regional level across the EU .
but we believe that the Covenant can do so much more , as our negotiations with the US Conference of Mayors have shown .
we call upon Commissioner @-@ designate Oettinger to formali@@ se the role of the Committee within the Covenant of Mayors .
&quot; the EU has expressed its disappointment at the lack of ambition in the Copenhagen agreement , and has pledged to continue its efforts to cut emissions .

the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
CoR president supports the European Commission &apos;s policy of zero tolerance towards discrimination against the Roma
the fight against prejudice and hostile attitudes towards the Roma is at the heart of a draft Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) opinion proposing practical measures to improve the integration of the Roma population .
supporting the Commission &apos;s position on this matter , the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives calls on Member States , regions and local authorities to apply with vigour the fundamental rights enshrined in the European treaties and to combat all forms of discrimination directed against the Roma people .
the CoR president , Mercedes Bresso has stated that &quot; the Roma community continue to be frequent victims of discrimination and social exclusion in European as well as other countries , which is a breach of the fundamental values of the European Union and human rights .
clearly , there is a need to raise national , regional and local administrations &apos; awareness of their responsibility to respect the fundamental rights of every European citizen . &quot;
however , the CoR is concerned about the effectiveness of current policies , which suffer from lack of awareness about the Roma population among local authorities .
the diagnosis of the situation by the rapporteur , a member of Ravenna municipal council , is severe : &quot;
to remedy the situation , the CoR rapporteur proposes solutions at three levels : &quot;
at European level , I hope to see the establishment of a strategy for the implementation of common policies in the various Member States , and access to European funds for projects undertaken by local authorities . &quot;
at national level &quot; I believe that there is an urgent need for Member States to adopt legislation to render European anti @-@ discrimination and pro @-@ rights legislation effective and applicable . &quot;
at local and regional level the rapporteur &quot; believes there is a need for territori@@ ally integrated regional policies and cooperation arrangements with the countries of origin of Roma migrants . &quot;

environment , cohesion policy and digital agenda in focus of CoR plenary
the flagship agreement , signed by CoR President Mercedes Bresso and US Conference of Mayors President Elizabeth Kau@@ tz , aims at bridging the experiences of the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement and of the EU Covenant of Mayors .
it highlights the willingness of local and regional authorities to move forward with concrete action despite the failure of national governments to agree in Copenhagen .
hosted by CoR President Bresso and Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn , the OPEN DAYS will showcase hundreds of successful EU @-@ funded projects in the regions .
the expiry of current cohesion funding schemes in 2013 and the adoption of ambitious &apos; Europe 2020 &apos; growth goals have sparked a debate about how cohesion policy should look in the future .
these indicators should reflect the concept of sustainable development .
this is the message from Vicente Álvarez A@@ rec@@ es ( ES / PES ) , President of the Autonomous Community of Asturias and CoR rapporteur on &quot; Meas@@ uring progress - GDP and beyond . &quot;
in many Member States , regions and cities are also key providers of social services and services of general interest , such as electricity , public transport and schooling .
maximising the economic and social benefits of information technology is the aim of the &apos; digital agenda &apos; promoted by Neelie Kroes , Vice @-@ President of the European Commission .
from affordable broadband access in rural areas to reliable and secure online services for citizens , this issue touches on some key competences of regional and local authorities .

the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
Tourna@@ i / Brussels , 1 October 2010
CoR and Belgian Presidency team up to reinforce territorial cooperation
while these projects have become the &quot; face of Europe &quot; in many regions , the EU &apos;s INTERREG funding schemes must also live up to new globalisation challenges , Bresso stated : &quot;
in view of the difficult economic situation under which the future EU budget will be negotiated , President Bresso said : &quot;
we are well aware of the budget challenge .
but we will not accept hand@@ outs to territorial cooperation in exchange for budget cuts somewhere else .
we need sufficient funding to ensure that territorial cooperation and cohesion policy can continue to deliver added value for Europe . &quot;
Walloon Prime Minister Ru@@ dy Dem@@ otte , who chairs meetings of EU ministers in charge of regional policy during the Belgian Presidency , underlined : &quot;
the Territorial Cooperation objective is an instrument which has an obvious European added value and which must be preserved , such as building European networks , cooperation development , and the exchange of knowledge and experience .
this instrument allows us to capitali@@ se on the benefits we have re@@ ap@@ ed for over 20 years . &quot;
regions and cities can set up such joint bodies without major administrative barriers and can then apply for any kind of EU or national funding .
in 2008 , Tourna@@ i , the French city of Lille and Kor@@ tri@@ jk in Flanders became the first in Europe to work together under this framework .
in the meantime many more have followed their example .
meeting yesterday in Tourna@@ i ahead of the Belgian Presidency conference , members of the Committee of the Regions &apos; Commission for territorial cohesion ( CO@@ TER ) discussed how to feed this grassroots experience into the forthcoming review of the EG@@ TC regulation .
prepared by Alberto N@@ ú@@ ñ@@ ez Fei@@ j@@ ó@@ o ( ES / EPP ) , President of Galicia , the Committee &apos;s opinion on the EG@@ TC review is scheduled for adoption in early 2011 .
Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre ( FR / PES ) , Chairman of the CO@@ TER Commission , Mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k and in this capacity initi@@ ator of an EG@@ TC re@@ grouping the Belgian province of West Flanders and the French Op@@ al Coast , commented : &quot;
we are surely not on the defensive when it comes to the role of interregional cooperation in the future programming period .
on the contrary , we believe that territorial cooperation and tools like the EG@@ TC still have great potential , especially when it comes to creating economies of scale and alleviating public sector budgets .
we want more territorial cooperation to generate more efficiency and more savings . &quot;
other items on the agenda of the CO@@ TER Commission were the reactions of regions and cities to the European Commission &apos;s 2010 strategy report on the implementation of cohesion policy , drafted by Constan@@ tin Ost@@ af@@ ici@@ u@@ c ( RO / EPP ) , Chairman of Tim@@ i@@ ş Bor@@ ough Council .
rapporteur Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) , European Affairs State Secretary of Saxony @-@ Anhalt discussed his draft opinion on the role of cohesion policy in implementing the new Europe 2020 strategy with CO@@ TER members .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
Europe 2020 must learn from cohesion policy governance model , CoR says
EU cohesion policy will play a key role in translating the Europe 2020 targets into practice , but its main objective remains reducing wealth gaps between regions .
by involving all levels of government , cohesion policy has set an example for Territorial P@@ acts aimed at implementing Europe 2020 , states an opinion adopted at the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) plenary session in Brussels today .
CoR rapporteur Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) also warned against a multiplic@@ ation of sector @-@ specific EU funding programmes and insisted on keeping the European Social Fund in the cohesion policy framework .
in response , the CoR adopted its opinion today which sees cohesion policy and the new strategy as &quot; interdependent , &quot; but insists that the former remains a policy in its own right with goals set by the EU treaty .
CoR members also insist that the Europe 2020 initiatives must not increase red tape for regional and local authorities .
introducing new reporting obligations , shifting money away from structural funds to new sector @-@ specific funds , or removing the European Social Fund from the cohesion framework would mean exactly that and is therefore rejected by the CoR .
Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) , European affairs state secretary of Saxony @-@ Anhalt , who drafted the opinion , said : &quot;
it is becoming increasingly accepted that the lack of involvement at the local and regional level contributed to the failure of the Lisbon Strategy .
we are therefore calling on national governments to work in partnership with their local and regional authorities when defining their national reform programmes on the Europe 2020 Strategy and to ensure that all levels of government are involved at both the development and implementation stages .
cohesion policy , with its cross @-@ sector approach and system of multi @-@ level governance , could therefore make a significant contribution to reaching the targets of Europe 2020 . &quot;
Johannes Hahn , EU Commissioner for Regional Policy , welcomed the CoR opinion and stated : &quot;
regional investment , funding our regions in a wise and targeted way , is the key to get Europe out of the crisis .
we must prepare our regions for global competition , where no longer countries , but continents will compete with each other .
by focusing our future investments on energy efficiency , green and sustainable development and thus creating new jobs , we will get the results we want to achieve with the Europe 2020 Strategy .
I therefore thank the Committee of the Regions for their endorsement of this approach , which means we can work successfully together in the interest of all . &quot;
to unleash the synergies and systemic effects needed to fulfil a smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , and in the light of its White paper on Multi @-@ Level Governance , the Committee of the Regions at its Bureau meeting has given the green light for Europe @-@ wide campaign in favour of Territorial P@@ acts .
the CoR calls for a converging effort of the European institutions to support the process and to encourage the establishment of the Territorial P@@ acts between national governments and the Regional and Local Authorities .
Mercedes Bresso , President of the Committee of the Regions , explained the aim of this concept : &quot;
the Europe 2020 strategy requires a broad partnership .
it must be put into practice in each region and city through concrete measures and a shared responsibility between the national level on the one hand and the regional and local levels on the other .
the CoR President also called for the development of new indicators that provide a more meaningful way of measuring prosperity , well @-@ being and quality of life in Europe , as proposed by Vicente Álvarez A@@ rec@@ es ( ES / PES ) , President of the Autonomous Community of Asturias , whose opinion on &quot; Meas@@ uring progress - GDP and beyond &quot; was also adopted today .

the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
in the so @-@ called EU &quot; Macro @-@ Regions , &quot; regions and countries are working together on flagship cross @-@ border projects dealing with environmental protection and transport for example .
in this way , solutions can be found for problems that one country is unable to tackle alone and which are too specific for general EU rules .
cooperation of this kind is already happening in the Baltic and a similar strategy is currently being developed for the Danube area .
the Committee of the Regions was the driving force behind both projects and is now the first EU forum to be calling for a European strategy for the North Sea and English Channel area .
Hermann Kuhn ( DE / PES ) , a member of the Bremen Regional Parliament and CoR rapporteur on this subject , is convinced of the need for a strategy of this kind .
the problems in the North Sea and English Channel are pressing - over @-@ fishing , pollution and the permanent switch from oil production to wind power .
a European strategy can give us a platform for closer cooperation in which the regions and cities can have a voice and wi@@ eld influence . &quot;
closer cooperation from Rotterdam to Reykjavik
this means the EU Member States of Sweden , Denmark , Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium , France and Great Britain , together with the non @-@ EU states of Norway and Iceland .
the CoR calls for general guidelines for &quot; Macro @-@ Regions &quot;
the Baltic strategy introduced the concept of &quot; Macro @-@ Regions &quot; into European policy and many other regions want to follow this example .

European and US mayors sign up for climate action at CoR Plenary Session
the Covenant now has 2000 towns , 25 capital cities and 100 regions as supporting structures .
the Memorandum of Understanding comes as a result of months of cooperation between the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) and the US Conference of Mayors , spurred on by a desire to move the climate action agenda forward after the disappointing results of Copenhagen .
it strives to accelerate local measures on both sides of the Atlantic to improve the energy efficiency of buildings , to promote renewable energy sources and sustainable urban mobility , as well as to change citizens &apos; behaviour .
the memorandum also aims to mobilise regional and local leaders to voice their demands in the run @-@ up to the Cancun Climate Summit in December .
Commissioner for Climate Action , Connie Hedegaard , who addressed the Committee of the Regions immediately before the signing ceremony , said : &quot;
in parallel with the international negotiations , the EU needs to push forward the process of making the European economy climate @-@ friendly .
Europe needs to maintain its lead in the low @-@ carbon technologies of the future within a fierce worldwide competition .
by doing so we can stimulate green growth , safeguard jobs and strengthen our energy security .
that is why the Commission has made &apos; de @-@ carbon@@ ising &apos; the EU economy one of the pillars of the Europe 2020 strategy . &quot;
President Elisabeth B. Kau@@ tz said : &quot;
the strong commitment of US mayors to climate protection has been instrumental to placing the issue on the national agenda .
mayors in the US are developing and implementing sustainability plans and comprehensive strategies to protect the environment .
the Conference is very pleased to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Committee of the Regions of the European Union , with the support of the European Commission , to continue our close and strong relationship . &quot;
referring to the cooperation agreement with the US mayors and to the CoR &apos;s resolution for Cancun , which is on the Committee &apos;s agenda tomorrow , President Mercedes Bresso said : &quot;
national leaders have a responsibility to the planet to sign an internationally binding agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Cancun .
together we will propose a new model for funding local projects out of the Emissions Trading Scheme . &quot;
President Bresso said : &quot;
the Covenant is entering a new phase .
if the Sustainable Energy Action Plans being adopted across the whole of Europe are to be efficiently implemented , political and financial support from the European and national institutions is now more important than ever . &quot;
President Bresso &apos;s call has been backed by the findings of the CoR Europe 2020 Platform &apos;s Survey on sustainable energy policies by EU regions and cities .
the survey presents best practice from more than 200 local and regional authorities all over Europe and identifies three necessary success factors to achieve Europe &apos;s 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 goals on the ground : political leadership , a multi@@ level governance approach and budgetary and technical support to local authorities .
the CoR will also forward the findings of the survey , and its proposals for more effective grass roots climate action at the local and regional level , to European Council President Herman Van Rompuy , who has called a special energy council for early 2011 to discuss the issue .

press Release
European efforts to tackle the economic crisis need better coordination and faster implementation on the ground , was the message of a conference organised by the Spanish EU Presidency and the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) in Palma de Mallorca today , the 5 th Territorial Dialogue for Sustainable Growth and Jobs .
at this year &apos;s event , participants had an opportunity to debate the future EU@@ 2020 Strategy , that gives priority to achieve a sustainable , smarter and greener social market economy .
in autumn 2009 , the CoR had asked regional and local authorities from all over Europe to assess progress during the first year of the European recovery plan , launched by national leaders in December 2008 .
three quarters of responding municipalities and regions recorded a rise in unemployment , while two thirds were forced to increase expenditure on social and welfare services .
only a quarter expect an economic recovery for this year .
one of the key concerns voiced by the participating regions and cities is the lack of coordination between the various levels of government , as well as slow implementation of decre@@ ed measures on the ground .
for CoR President Luc Van den Brande , the survey results clearly show the need for all political actors to work together in putting the European economy back on track : &quot;
the economic crisis is a European problem , even though some areas are hit harder than others , and our response has to be European too .
however , a sustainable recovery cannot be achieved by decree from above , a &quot; top @-@ down &quot; approach won &apos;t deliver results on the ground .
what we need is a broad dialogue about the next steps .
faced with shrinking public revenues , many local and regional authorities are struggling to keep up the front@@ line services that our citizens rely on , from education and healthcare to waste management and many others .
they must be properly involved in preparing the national and EU plans to counteract the effects of the crisis . &quot;
in his opinion , the changes experienced by the world before and , above all , after the crisis &quot; show us that things are no longer the same , although the objectives and values we defend have not changed . &quot;
for this reason , the Spanish presidency considers it important not to weaken any of those fronts but , rather , to strengthen coordination between the various levels so that policy is more effective . &quot; ( an interview with Manuel Cha@@ ves on the challenges of the Spanish EU presidency and the current economic crisis is available on the CoR website . )
the Territorial Dialogue for Sustainable Growth and Jobs is an annual conference co @-@ organised by the Committee of the Regions and the incumbent EU Presidency .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
Committee of the Regions urges regions and cities to sign up for climate action
the EU &apos;s Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) has urged all sub @-@ national governments to invest more in the fight against climate change .
in its Resolution on the Cancun Climate Summit adopted today the CoR appeals to regions and local authorities to sign local climate action p@@ acts setting out concrete measures in the fight against climate change .
the appeal follows the signing yesterday of a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation on climate action by CoR President Mercedes Bresso and Elizabeth B. Kau@@ tz , President of the United States Conference of Mayors .
the memorandum strives to accelerate local measures on both sides of the Atlantic to improve the energy efficiency of buildings , to promote renewable energy sources and sustainable urban mobility , as well as to change citizens &apos; behaviour .
in its Cancun resolution the CoR reaffirms its call for an international climate change agreement limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2012 .
they must raise public awareness , mobilise public political support , business investment and funding sources and motivate producers and consumers to change their behaviour , states the resolution .
regions and cities should conclude local climate action p@@ acts between public and private partners setting out concrete climate action measures to reach the 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 goal .
the EU Commissioner for Climate Action , Connie Hedegaard , who addressed the Committee of the Regions this week said : &quot;
in parallel with the international negotiations , the EU needs to push forward the process of making the European economy climate @-@ friendly .
Europe needs to maintain its lead in the low @-@ carbon technologies of the future within a fierce worldwide competition .
by doing so we can stimulate green growth , safeguard jobs and strengthen our energy security . &quot;
to enhance the financing of local climate action the Committee of the Regions requests that climate change is main@@ streamed in budgets at all government levels .
climate action should become a transversal priority in the forthcoming EU Budget , while access to European Investment Bank loans for regions and local authorities should be facilitated .
background info for editors
the 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 goal
in 2005 renewable energy from hydro power , solar , wind , biomass or geothermal sources accounted for less than seven percent of the EU &apos;s total energy consumption .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
Mercedes Bresso has hailed the Europe 2020 Strategy as a first step in the right direction away from the neo @-@ liberal agenda which Europe has pursued so far .
but more steps are necessary to re @-@ establish the right balance between the economic , environmental and social goals of Europe , the Committee of the Regions President said in a keynote speech last Thursday .
it would be wrong to believe that economic growth leads automatically to economic and social development , Bresso stressed .
&quot; we must stop giving almost systematic priority to economic criteria over human ones , stop encouraging mobility if it adversely affects standards of living or environmental conditions , stop developing ever more sophisticated financial mechanisms , when local private savings are harness@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Europe 2020 Strategy is a credible response to the many challenges facing the EU today , particularly globalisation and the recession .
it remains ; however , strongly inspired by the neo @-@ liberal model reign@@ ing during the post @-@ 2000 years , which has damaged the planet &apos;s environment and climate , reinforced income disparities and social exclusion and has created the de@@ generation of public services .
Europe , and its future EU regional policy , should dare to cross the Rubi@@ con and leave neo @-@ liberalism behind , &quot;

Brussels , 6 October 2010
hom@@ elessness in Europe : &quot;
economic growth must not leave anyone by the way@@ side &quot;
how should government action be framed to ensure a more mutually @-@ supportive society ?
on Wednesday 6 October , the CoR invited Lau@@ rette On@@ kel@@ in@@ x , Belgian minister for social affairs and president in office of the Social Policy and Health Council , to discuss European social policy with European local and regional elected representatives in Brussels .
tore Hul@@ t &apos;s own @-@ initiative opinion on combating hom@@ elessness is part and parcel of the political activities launched by the CoR during the European year against poverty and social exclusion .
the CoR invited the Belgian minister for social integration , Lau@@ rette On@@ kel@@ in@@ x to represent the presidency in office of the EU at the adoption of this key opinion .
her presence was emblematic , partly because she had been a long @-@ term CoR member but primarily because in 1993 , it was she who pushed Belgium to adopt a law giving mayors the right to requi@@ sition any abandoned building to serve as accommodation for homeless people .
&quot; social services of general interest play a pivotal role in European society and are largely responsible for achieving the EU &apos;s fundamental objectives , such as social , economic and territorial cohesion , social inclusion and economic growth .
however , a legal framework based solely on the logic of the market economy is not suited to the organisational structure of social services .
the Belgian presidency wants to give social services of general interest a proper framework and more legal certainty , . &quot;
CoR President Mercedes Bresso assured the Belgian Presidency that it could rely on the CoR &apos;s &quot; full and un@@ stin@@ ting support in its plan to give social services of general interest a stable framework . &quot;
CoR rapporteur Tore Hul@@ t stressed that in the CoR &apos;s view , combating hom@@ elessness should be a priority for the EU &apos;s social inclusion policy and the Europe 2020 strategy .
&quot; good quality , affordable housing is a fundamental need as well as a right .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledges that everyone has the right to social and housing assistance .
a high level of hom@@ elessness is un@@ worthy of the EU . &quot;
the main obstacle to combating hom@@ elessness is the pan@@ op@@ ly of policies involved and the division of responsibilities between authorities .
this proposal echoes the position of over 95 MEPs who have asked the Council to pledge by the end of 2010 to settle the issue of homeless people by 2015 , and have called on the Commission to launch a bold strategy for homeless people in the EU .

Tallinn , 14 October 2010
Baltic Sea strategy delivered first results for the citizens , Commissioner Hahn and CoR President Bresso say
one year after its adoption , the European Union &apos;s strategy for the Baltic Sea region has started delivering results for the citizens .
now we have to keep up the momentum .
this was the message delivered by Estonian President To@@ omas Hend@@ rik Il@@ ves , EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn and Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) President Mercedes Bresso at the first Baltic Sea Forum in Tallinn today .
the Baltic Sea area is pioneering a new form of cross @-@ border cooperation in the EU : in this first European &quot; macro@@ region , &quot; all levels of government are working together to tackle challenges which no country can face on its own , but which are too specific for EU rules .
they develop and implement joint flagship projects , such as combating marine pollution or strengthening transport links .
To@@ omas Hend@@ rik Il@@ ves , President of the Republic of Estonia , commented : &quot;
we hear often that Europe must be brought closer to the citizen , as it indeed should be .
the Baltic Sea Strategy is actually the first EU strategy to have originated in the European Parliament .
it is the first EU policy initiative to get its start from those people democratically and directly elected by the citizens of the European Union . &quot;
now that the mechanisms for implementation are in place , the strategy has started delivering results on the ground , stated CoR President Mercedes Bresso : &quot;
now we need to keep the political momentum .
cities , towns and regions will do this .
for example , we need to keep the good pace of progress on the strategy &apos;s environment pillar .
a group of flagship projects are leading the way on key issues like fighting eutrophi@@ cation and climate change , as well as boosting &quot; clean shipping . &quot;
Bresso underlined the huge potential of this new approach , for instance the economies of scale that joint projects can generate : &quot;
at European level , we need to capitali@@ se on the work done in the Baltic .
the Baltic strategy could thus serve as a model for other European regions , such as the Adriatic @-@ Ionian Sea . &quot;
Johannes Hahn , EU Commissioner for Regional Policy , said : &quot;
this strategy shows that if an initiative is taken by regions and member states , cooperation on the ground can happen quickly and in a very effective way .
the Baltic Sea region , as defined by the EU strategy , comprises Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland and Sweden .
the &quot; Northern Dimension , &quot; a common policy of the EU , Russia , Norway and Iceland , provides the basis for external cooperation on the strategy .
the Committee of the Regions has been a consistent supporter of this new &quot; macro@@ regional &quot; approach , and published reports on the Baltic sea strategy in April 2009 and April 2010 .
in the framework of her visit to Tallinn , CoR President Bresso also held talks with the Estonian members of the Committee of the Regions and the Presidents of the Estonian associations representing local authorities .

press Release
Brussels , 4.@@ 11.@@ 2010
today , just a few days after the European Commission adopted its communication on the EU budget review , the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget , Janusz Lewandowski , took part in an exercise in &quot; structured dialogue &quot; with the political representatives of associations of local and regional authorities at the Committee of the Regions building in Brussels .
responding to a wide range of questions on the future of cohesion policy after 2013 - and how it is to be funded - Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski reiterated his determination to pursue an integrated and consistent approach .
we need to find a way to align cohesion policy with the Europe 2020 strategy and ensure that the criteria do not become unduly constra@@ ining and bureaucratic . &quot;
&quot; it is important for the Europe 2020 strategy to be able to take on board the commitments of national and regional partners .
but we should bear in mind that the added value of the European budget is to some extent a younger si@@ bling of the subsidiarity principle . &quot;
Commissioner Lewandowski addressed the issue of EU budget funding , in particular the question of &quot; own resources , &quot; a number examples of which are mentioned in the Commission document .
&quot; the Member States , meeting today just a stone &apos;s throw away from the Committee of the Regions &apos; building , are asking us to come up with ideas here .
in our discussions , nothing must be off @-@ limits . &quot;
Mercedes Bresso agreed that , on this point , that &quot; there is no such thing as a high @-@ yielding pain @-@ free tax .
we will therefore have to choose the least bad solution and think of the &apos; benefits &apos; it will bring through the new EU actions .
for us , as local and regional representatives , this means that we will probably opt for the resource with the least negative impact on territorial cohesion and the best prospects for greener and more inclusive growth . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;ll be analysing the governance of the budget and stressing the importance of a transparent , citizen @-@ friendly structure that focuses on objectives that add value , such as territorial cohesion . &quot;
Mr Val@@ cár@@ cel also noted the importance of including a flexibility clause throughout the multi @-@ annual programming period in order &quot; to avoid under @-@ using resources and to strengthen the best performing strategic budget headings with greatest citizen recognition . &quot;
quotations from representatives of associations of regional and local authorities taking part in the structured dialogue meeting :
Gérard One@@ sta ( CoR member , vice @-@ president responsible for European affairs of the Regional Council of the Midi @-@ Pyrénées Region , Association des Ré@@ gi@@ ons de France ( AR@@ F ) ( association of French regions )
&quot; the Lisbon strategy did not deliver the expected results because the grassroots authorities in direct contact with EU citizens were not sufficiently involved in its implementation .
we must not make the same mistake with the Europe 2020 strategy . &quot;
Cat@@ arina Se@@ ger@@ sten @-@ Lar@@ sson , ( CoR member , member of the Assembly of V@@ ärm@@ land County Council ) , Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions ( SAL@@ AR )
&quot; economic , social and territorial cohesion are objectives of the EU , clearly stated in the Lisbon Treaty .
the Structural Funds are vital tools to achieve these objectives , and the objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy .
the territorial perspective permits us , the local and regional level , to make the most out of our potential , with local solutions to global and European challenges . &quot;
Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre , ( CoR member , mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k ) , Mission op@@ é@@ ration@@ nelle trans@@ fron@@ tali@@ ère ( MO@@ T ) ( cross @-@ border operational mission )
&quot; we want EU @-@ co @-@ funded projects that contribute to greater territorial cohesion between and within regions and that make sense on the ground .
the Commission should offer regions flexibility by putting forward an &apos; à la carte &apos; menu that allows regions to evaluate the level of effort required for each major challenge set at EU level . &quot;
A@@ lin Adrian N@@ ica , ( CoR member , mayor of Du@@ des@@ ti@@ i No@@ i ) , Romanian Association of Commun@@ es ( A@@ CoR )
&quot; the Commission &apos;s communication on the EU budget review speaks about principles on which the EU spending must be grounded and the fact that the budget should mirror the EU &apos;s core policy priorities .
regional development and rural development policies are of greatest importance for us , representatives of local and regional authorities because it helps us to develop our plans for investments in a coherent way , in order to address existing challenges in an integrated manner . &quot;
Christophe Rou@@ illon , ( CoR member , Mayor of Cou@@ la@@ ines ) , Association des Ma@@ ires de France ( AM@@ F ) ( association of French mayors )
&quot; current Lisbon ear@@ marking is too narrow , and although the next EU policies will be governed by the Europe 2020 strategy , we will have to ensure that priorities are extended to the EU &apos;s new challenges in the areas of climate change , demogra@@ phy , and so on , and , above all , that they take account of territorial cohesion .
transparent and simplified procedures have to be put in place to ensure that local authorities of all sizes are not discouraged from participating in European projects and that credit take @-@ up is good . &quot;

green energy , civil protection and social inclusion key to Danube strategy , CoR President Bresso tells Bucharest summit
EU efforts to strengthen cooperation in the Danube area must generate real added value for citizens , Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) President Mercedes Bresso emphasised .
addressing European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Heads of Government from the region at the Danube summit in Bucharest , President Bresso urged support for local projects on renewable energy and common civil protection measures , as well as social inclusion .
the Danube region will soon follow the example of the Baltic Sea area and become the second European &apos; macro@@ region &apos; to benefit from a tailor @-@ made strategy tackling cross @-@ border challenges .
a few weeks before the European Commission is set to publish its strategy proposals , the Romanian government invited leaders from the Danube countries to Bucharest on Monday .
CoR President Mercedes Bresso joined Romanian President Tra@@ ian B@@ ă@@ s@@ escu and Prime Minister Emil Bo@@ c , Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban , representing the incoming Council Presidency , Commission President José Manuel Barroso , and more than 20 Heads of Government and high @-@ level politicians to this Danube summit .
the CoR President emphasised : &quot;
the Danube Region is an integration laboratory for Europe .
if we want to improve the quality of life in the Danube area and tackle its economic and environmental problems , we need a common vision , an integrated strategy and stronger institutional cooperation , including the use of the European Grou@@ ping of Territorial Cooperation ( EG@@ TC ) . &quot;
regional and local actors have to be fully involved in this process and a strong EU budget should be put in place if the strategy is to succeed and to deliver concrete benefits for the citizens : &quot;
for instance , support for local renewable energy projects would stimulate the creation of &apos; green jobs &apos; in the area .
we also need to coordinate our disaster prevention and civil protection mechanisms better and upgrade the EU Solidarity Fund .
recurring floods and disasters like the recent toxic sludge spill don &apos;t come to a halt at national borders , and neither should the response to them . &quot;
the Committee of the Regions is the first EU body to have adopted a report , as early as October 2009 , calling for a European strategy on the Danube Region .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
regional and local leaders welcome Commission plans for cohesion funding
Committee of the Regions President Mercedes Bresso told EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn in Brussels today that they were &apos; a step in the right direction &apos; .
the Commission plans would benefit all regions , supporting their efforts to create better economic opportunities for all , improve living conditions and sustained development .
at the same time , President Bresso rejected the idea of freezing regional aid for over@@ spending countries .
this would unfairly punish regional and local governments for decisions taken at national levels .
EU regional aid co @-@ finances thousands of projects , from waste water plants to training for the unemployed and innovation clusters .
current funding programmes expire in 2013 and need to be revised .
to discuss how this impacts on regions and cities , the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) brought together EU Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn , CoR members and politicians from associations representing regional and local authorities on the occasion of a debate held today in Brussels at CoR headquarters .
Committee of the Regions President Mercedes Bresso said that the report &quot; addresses many of the issues we flag@@ ged up in the last couple of years . &quot;
the CoR President hailed the EU executive &apos;s plea to continue to make cohesion money available to all regions in the future , and lau@@ ded plans to coordinate the various EU funds better .
on one of the Commission &apos;s most controversial proposals , Bresso stressed : &quot;
regions must not be punished for the failures of their national governments .
freezing EU funds for countries that breach the stability pact is not a solution .
if anything , it will only worsen the situation in these regions . &quot;
on the idea of &apos; merit points &apos; that could lead to extra EU regional funding , she added : &quot;
in principle I accept the idea of a &apos; European reserve &apos; for EU money .
this extra cash could be awarded half way through the programmes , to respond to new challenges .
but I am not convinced that we should real@@ locate funds on the basis of how much they contributed to the &apos; Europe 2020 &apos; targets . &quot;
the Committee &apos;s official report on these plans will be prepared over the coming months by Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre ( FR / PES ) .
the Mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k and Chairman of the COR &apos;s Commission for territorial cohesion said : &quot;
I welcome the bold proposals on multi @-@ level governance and the impressive analytical work , which inevitably can only rely on pre @-@ crisis figures .
on the other hand , we have a lot of work to do on some concrete questions such as the double process of more &apos; ear@@ marking &apos; in combination with more concentration of funds .
in my opinion this reduces the room for manoeuvre of regional and local authorities . &quot;
the CoR also welcomed the suggested transition arrangements for regions that are about to drop out of the highest funding category .
Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) , European affairs state secretary of Saxony @-@ Anhalt , who drafted the CoR &apos;s position on the future of cohesion policy and its contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy earlier this year , emphasised : &quot;
it is good that the Commission has taken up the issue of transition regions , with which the CoR has actively been engaged .
we have to take the appropriate measures to ensure that funding for &apos; convergence regions &apos; which would lose eligibility for the highest category after 2013 doesn &apos;t drop too much .
this is the only way to guarantee the sustainability of European investments . &quot;
notes to editors - context and next steps
the EU treaty obliges the European Commission to publish a report every three years on the progress made towards achieving &apos; economic , social and territorial cohesion &apos; , i.e. the efforts to close the development gaps between Europe &apos;s regions .
first legislative proposals are expected for summer 2011 .

CoR President Bresso warns ministers against EU funding freeze for countries fl@@ outing budget rules
Committee of the Regions President Mercedes Bresso today reiterated a warning against an EU &quot; funding freeze &quot; for countries that breach budget deficit rules .
speaking to member states &quot; ministers in charge of regional policy in Liège , Bresso urged their support and stressed that Commission proposals to create such links need to be &quot; completely re@@ worked . &quot;
the Belgian Presidency had invited member states &apos; ministers , EU Commissioners Johannes Hahn and László Andor , Danuta Hübner , Chair@@ woman of the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Regional Development and Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) President Mercedes Bresso for talks on the future of EU regional policy .
the debates centred on recent Commission proposals to align regional programming closer to the &apos; Europe 2020 &apos; goals , tough@@ en up its rules and link it more to policy and budget performance .
commenting on these plans , CoR President Bresso said : &quot;
we are firmly opposed to the proposed &quot; macroeconomic conditionality . &quot;
it is not acceptable to punish regions by withholding structural funds money from them , as it is national governments that don &apos;t respect the stability and growth pact . &quot;
following first discussions with national ministers , she added : &quot;
I was pleased to see that several member states expressed similar concerns .
not only to keep regions as partners and allies , but also to put the Europe 2020 strategy on the right track . &quot;
a key question debated by ministers was how cohesion policy and the Europe 2020 goals should be linked in the future .
at the request of the Belgian Presidency , the CoR had explored the issue in a recent opinion , drafted by Michael Schneider ( DE / EPP ) .
summ@@ arising the CoR &apos;s position , President Bresso said : &quot;
we agree that regional aid should contribute to smarter , greener and more inclusive growth , provided that the specific nature of each region is taken into account .
cohesion policy must give regions the option of seizing development opportunities outside of the Europe 2020 framework and to choose only some selected priorities .
this is more than a question of subsidiarity , it is also a question of efficiency . &quot;
the Committee of the Regions had already brought together regional and local politicians from across the EU last week to discuss their first reactions .
the CoR &apos;s official response to the Commission plans will be drafted in the coming months by Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre ( FR / PES ) , Mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k .

van den Brande asks Commissioner @-@ designate Hahn to believe more in the real importance of multi @-@ level governance and to consider regions and cities as real partners
he reassured that the Committee of the Regions will be a solid partner in such a dialogue and invited Johannes Hahn to address the Committee of the Regions &apos; February Plenary session .
addressing the Commission &apos;s newly designated regional policy chief and the members of the European Parliament &apos;s committee on regional development , Van den Brande emphasised that regional policy is not just a vehicle for other strategic goals .
instead , it has to be a &quot; global European development policy at the disposal of all European citizens . &quot;
this is especially important as Europe &apos;s new rule@@ book , the Lisbon treaty , now requires the EU to respect the principle of &quot; territorial cohesion &quot; - meaning the harmonious development of all regions in the European Union : &quot;
all EU policies must recognize the impacts of their activities on the ground and must be aware of their effects on local communities .
all EU policies need to take this new objective into account in their planning , implementation and evaluation stages . &quot;
Commissioner @-@ designate Johannes Hahn strongly argued against the renationalisation of regional policy and stressed his willingness to work together with regions and local authorities : &quot;
we need the expertise of the regions to sustain a successful regional policy and to modernise it .
at the same time , European regional policy has to follow an integrated approach and must be linked to all other EU policies .
the success , reform and implementation of regional policy can only be achieved through coordination at the European level , and in cooperation with the regions . &quot;
the Commissioner @-@ designate also spoke in favour of a close working relationship with the Committee of the Regions : &quot;
cooperation with the Committee of the Regions will be very important to me , to better understand and represent the concerns of regions and local authorities .
I look forward to developing a good partnership . &quot;
President Van den Brande addressed the hearing of Commissioner @-@ designate Johannes Hahn at the invitation of Danuta Hübner , Chair@@ woman of the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Regional Development ( RE@@ GI ) .

what priorities for 2011 ?
recently , both the European Parliament and the CoR have not hesit@@ ated to remind people of their new powers resulting from the Lisbon Treaty .
one year after the entry into force of the EU &apos;s new framework for action of the EU , the CoR has asked the President of the European Commission , José Manuel Barroso , to come and present the work programme and the ambitions of the Commission for 2011 .
Europe 2020 , reforms of cohesion policy and the Common Agricultural Policy , budget negotiations : the CoR &apos;s members expect the European Union to have the courage to support the efforts made far from Brussels by the regions and cities .
it is the message that they will adopt in their resolution on the CoR &apos;s political priorities for 2011 .
public procurement and services of general interest are key concerns of the CoR &apos;s members , especially in an economic context where action by the public authorities has to both support growth and , at the same time , fulfil social needs in a tight budgetary climate .
the debates will be re@@ transmitted on the Internet at : www.@@ cor@@ .@@ europa@@ .eu@@ .

press Release
addressing Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) members Wednesday afternoon in Brussels , Commission President José Manuel Barroso supported a greater role for regions and cities in achieving EU goals .
&quot; we cannot win the hearts and minds of citizens without the leadership of regional and local representatives that have to contribute to promote Europe .
you are essential relays for the Union . &quot;
the Commission President said he would push member states to involve regional and local authorities through &quot; territorial p@@ acts . &quot;
CoR President Mercedes Bresso welcomed this announcement , adding that the Europe 2020 targets can only be reached if all levels of government work together right from the beginning .
Commission President José Manuel Barroso was presenting his priorities for 2011 to mayors , coun@@ cill@@ ors and regional representatives from across Europe .
I will push member states to accept involvement of all parties in territorial p@@ acts . &quot;
CoR President Mercedes Bresso conc@@ urred that the success of EU flagship initiatives , as well as most EU policies , largely depended on a greater role for regions and cities : &quot;
we are ready to work together with the Commission , the member states and the European Parliament to realise these goals .
this must happen on an equal footing , and not with regions and cities being seen as mere implementing authorities . &quot;
the report concludes that , while some countries seek the participation of regional and local authorities , &quot; a lot remains to be done to ensure increased ownership of Europe 2020 through enhanced partnership in its implementation between all government levels . &quot;
President Barroso assured CoR members that the Commission &quot; will analyse the report very carefully . &quot;
looking ahead , in a resolution on its priorities for 2011 adopted today , the Committee of the Region emphasises the leverage effect that the EU budget has on the European economic recovery strategy and the financing of structural investments .
responding to recent pole@@ mics on EU regional aid , President Barroso told CoR members : &quot;
let us be clear , cohesion policy doesn ′ t only benefit the regions , it benefits Europe as a whole .
it is indispensable for the future of the European Union .
the European Commission is proud of the cohesion policy .
Mercedes Bresso agreed : &quot;
cohesion policy is one of Europe ′ s greatest achievements .
it has helped to modernise transport links , it has helped millions of people to find new jobs , and it has helped our efforts to protect the environment .
there is of course always room for further improvement and simplification .
but already today cohesion policy is the best @-@ controlled funding programme in the world . &quot;

CoR message to Cancún : climate action starts in the regions but must be part of a global agreement
climate change negotiators in Cancún must acknowledge the importance of local and regional authorities in tackling global warming or risk a repetition of last year &apos;s disappointment in Copenhagen , the Committee of the Regions has warned as the UN @-@ sponsored talks on climate action get underway in Mexico .
the vital work in cutting emissions already underway at local and regional level must be better supported and coordinated on both a European and global scale .
speaking after the adoption of her opinion on International Climate Change Policy Post @-@ Copenhagen at the CoR Plenary Session in Brussels on Wednesday , Nicola Beer ( DE / ALDE ) , who will represent the Committee in Cancún , said : &quot;
the Committee &apos;s message is clear : a top @-@ down approach that ignores sub @-@ national authorities will do nothing to advance the cause of climate action . &quot;
taking advantage of the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Barroso at the Plenary Session , the Committee &apos;s President Mercedes Bresso reiterated the CoR &apos;s willingness to work together with other institutions on this key dossier .
&quot; the Committee of the Regions is ready to reinforce its alliance with the European Commission in order to make Europe an international role model in tackling climate change at grassroots level .
another opinion adopted on Wednesday also calls for concrete action closer to home to support local and regional authorities in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions .
the opinion by Michel Leb@@ run ( BE / EPP ) on the EU Energy Action Plan highlights the link between the role of sub @-@ national authorities in promoting energy efficiency and the resultant benefits in terms of emissions .
&quot; transport , housing , public buildings and public lighting infrastructure all fall within the remit of local and regional authorities and are areas where substantial CO2 reductions and energy savings are possible .
sub @-@ national authorities are also responsible in many cases for encouraging changes in the behaviour of individuals - a vital element if energy efficiency , and therefore carbon reduction , targets are to be met .
that is why it is important for local and regional authorities to have greater access to EU funds , including direct loans from the European Investment Bank , to help them promote the development of renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency at the local or regional level . &quot;

budgetary discipline : &quot;
as European finance ministers scra@@ mble to c@@ law back the confidence of the financial markets , the sustainability of public finances is more than ever a priority for public authorities .
regions and cities are also affected by the Member States &apos; efforts to comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact .
nevertheless , a CoR opinion on economic policy coordination , warns Member States and the European Commission against the serious risks involved in applying rules disproportionately and without consultation .
CoR rapporteur , Konstant@@ inos Tat@@ sis ( EL / EPP ) has witnessed the impact of the economic and financial crisis in his pre@@ fecture , Drama @-@ Kav@@ ala @-@ Xan@@ thi , namely rising unemployment and dwindling budgetary transfers from Athens .
nevertheless , if these new rules are applied in@@ discrimin@@ ately and without consultation , they could undermine the recovery of economic growth as well as the confidence of EU citizens .
the rapporteur pointed out that the chief risk was that the measures adopted , by damaging economic recovery , would have the opposite of their intended effect .
&quot; I am sending out a warning to Member States : unless measures to rein back budget deficits are proportionate and balanced , budgetary adjustments will stifle short to medium term economic growth .
we need to minimise the impact of budget cuts in the main policy areas of the Europe 2020 strategy . &quot;
one solution put forward in the opinion is for the European Commission and the Council to be able to &quot; act more rapidly in the event of fiscal imbalances , while upholding the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and applying sanctions in stages , &quot; and without waiting for the situation to deteriorate .
the CoR opinion also stresses the point that &quot; disproportionately severe sanctions will undermine public support for European integration .
significant efforts would have to go into educating the public on the importance of budgetary discipline for more effective national policies . &quot;

decentrali@@ sing reforms and respect for minorities : the CoR calls on its eastern partners to go further
rights of minorities , decentralisation process and financial independence of local and regional authorities : despite the efforts already made by Armenia , Ukraine and Belarus , the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) calls on its eastern partners to go further with their reforms .
nearly a year after the first meetings on the subject at ministerial level , and having adopted opinions on Moldova and Georgia last October , the CoR is continuing to evaluate the situation of local and regional authorities in the Eastern Partnership countries .
it is essential that Ukrainian legislation guarantees the political , administrative and financial independence of local authorities .
the discussions on the subject were led by Werner Jo@@ st@@ meier , Member of the North Rhine @-@ Westphalia Land@@ tag ( DE / EPP ) .
in particular he recommends that in future the EU makes its financial support for Belarus and implementation of humanitarian aid projects even more contingent on progress in respecting human rights .
following the adoption of an opinion on Azerbaijan , scheduled for January , the CoR will be able to draw on these detailed analyses by holding the first EU / Eastern Partnership conference of local and regional authorities in Hungary in the first half of next year .
this work can also foster closer relations between the CoR and the Hungarian presidency of the European Union , which will make the Eastern Partnership one of its priorities .

regions and local authorities want Malmström to be more than a paper tiger
if she wants to avoid becoming an EU Home Affairs Commissioner who is merely a coordinator of EU member states &quot; national policies , however , she will also have to ensure regular dialogue and serious cooperation with those regions and local authorities which are the most influential political players in the areas of immigration , integration and security .
&quot; in these areas , success depends not only on good legislation and resolutions but most importantly on good government and efficient implementation .
in many EU member states the responsibility for implementing these policies on the ground lies with regions and local authorities .
said Luc Van den Brande , President of the EU Committee of the Regions .
but we also know that there is widespread feeling that the EU does not understand the local problems of immigration and integration .
we therefore need an EU Home Affairs Commissioner who goes beyond the institutional debates in Brussels .
we need a Commissioner who li@@ stens carefully to regions and local authorities and enters into a steady dialogue with them .
the Committee of the Regions expects Cecilia Malmström to take on this role and we stand ready to play our part in co @-@ organising this permanent dialogue , &quot;
regarding the EU &apos;s role in security policy , Van den Brande emphasised that security measures should always serve and protect democratic principles and must never themselves become a threat to a transparent and free society .
&quot; in the fight against terrorism and organised crime , striking the right balance between security and freedom of citizens is one of the most difficult political challenges we face .
this is a challenge we can only master in partnership .
we offer Cecilia Malmström our support but we call upon her to make the dialogue and cooperation with regions and local authorities the cent@@ re@@ piece of her policy method .
the European Commission will have to step up its efforts on communication , particularly in the crucial field of security .

AR@@ LE@@ M issues a rall@@ ying call to regions and cities to face up to the challenges of the Mediterranean
&quot; the peoples of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean region deserve to have their political representatives take action to make social and territorial cohesion a reality in the region .
it can boost economic development and thus enhance economic , social and territorial cohesion .
I am thus convinced that all levels of society must play their part .
referring to the work programme that the members of AR@@ LE@@ M had agreed at their inaugural meeting in Barcelona in 2010 , Mohamed Bou@@ dra , president of the Ta@@ za @-@ Al Ho@@ c@@ ei@@ ma @-@ Ta@@ oun@@ ate region and co @-@ president of the assembly , added : &quot;
AR@@ LE@@ M stated the aim of bringing a tangible dimension to the political discussions within the Union for the Mediterranean so as to overcome the block@@ ages of traditional diplomacy .
today , three reports have been adopted by consensus .
these achievements are significant for this young assembly , as the creation of AR@@ LE@@ M brought about hopes and expectations which must not be disappointed . &quot;
once adopted , these AR@@ LE@@ M position papers will be sent to the U@@ f@@ M and its general secretariat .
however , at the meeting in Agadir , the reports already gave rise to bilateral contacts between the rapporteurs and Lati@@ fa Ak@@ h@@ arb@@ ach , Junior Minister in the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation , and Raf@@ iq Huss@@ eini , deputy secretary general in charge of water at the U@@ f@@ M secretariat , to explore what concrete follow @-@ up will be given to these recommendations .
the co @-@ presidents of AR@@ LE@@ M also welcomed the fact that the U@@ f@@ M had listened to their request , as a meeting at ministerial level on urban development was announced , modelled on the ministerial meetings on water and the environment in which AR@@ LE@@ M had already been involved .
AR@@ LE@@ M members will meet for their next plenary session in January 2012 in Bari ( Italy ) , following an invitation from the President of the Puglia Region , Ni@@ chi Vend@@ ola .
the latest information on AR@@ LE@@ M &apos;s activities , as well as the full text of the documents that were adopted , can be found at www.cor.europa.eu / ar@@ lem .
note to editors
AR@@ LE@@ M is a response to the request to put the role of regional and local authorities in the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership on an institutional footing .
it therefore gives the partnership a territorial dimension and seeks to involve local and regional authorities more closely in the specific projects of the Union for the Mediterranean .
AR@@ LE@@ M is composed of 84 members from the European Union and its 16 Mediterranean partners : members are representatives of regions and local bodies and hold a regional or local authority mandate .
AR@@ LE@@ M is chaired by a co @-@ presidency , equally representing the Mediterranean partners and the EU .
the co @-@ president of the Mediterranean partners , currently Mohamed Bou@@ dra , president of the region of Ta@@ za @-@ Al Ho@@ c@@ ei@@ ma @-@ Ta@@ oun@@ ate ( Morocco ) , is confirmed by consensus of that group for a period of two and a half years .
the co @-@ president from the EU is the president of the CoR , currently Mercedes Bresso .

Europe 2020 strategy and territorial p@@ acts : the Hungarian presidency visits the CoR
CoR President Mercedes Bresso called for the presidency &apos;s support in making &quot; territorial p@@ acts &quot; a reality across all Member States , thereby giving practical shape to the Europe 2020 strategy on the ground .
&quot; all stakeholders in society must rally to the cause of economic growth and territorial cohesion in Europe .
but we will deliver only if all relevant government levels do their job - not in isolation from each other , but in a coordinated , integrated and synchron@@ ised manner . &quot;
echo@@ ing the CoR president &apos;s request , the Mayor of Gö@@ d@@ ö@@ ll@@ ö , Györ@@ gy G@@ é@@ mes@@ i , called for territorial p@@ acts to be placed on the agenda of the forthcoming Spring European Council .
Mr Ré@@ t@@ vá@@ ri - himself a former member of Budapest city council - was attending the CoR &apos;s first plenary session of 2011 and outlined how the Hungarian presidency intended to involve the local and regional authorities in achieving its objectives .
two particular issues will be the focus of close cooperation between the CoR and the Hungarian presidency : regions and cities &apos; expertise in managing and conserving water resources , and the added value that cooperation projects at regional and city level can bring to the Eastern Partnership .
this plenary session also saw the CoR adopt the last in its series of six opinions on Eastern Partnership countries , which form the basis of the CoR &apos;s position on the subject .
it is also against this backdrop that the first meeting of the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of the Eastern Partnership is to be organised by the CoR this April , in partnership with the Hungarian presidency .
this will provide a forum for discussion between CoR members and representatives of regions and cities across the partner countries , with a view to promoting the principles of local democracy and cross @-@ border cooperation instruments .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
CoR urges continuation of ambitious EU regional development policy
on Thursday , regional and local politicians from across Europe will flesh out their proposals for the future structural funds in detail .
this year &apos;s edition brings together 800 policymakers and stakeholders , including Commission President José Manuel Barroso , EU Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn , Prime Ministers Viktor Orbán from Hungary , Donald Tus@@ k from Poland and Andri@@ us Ku@@ bili@@ us from Lithuania , as well as CoR members and other regional and local representatives .
it marks the end of the Commission &apos;s consultation launched last autumn , when it presented its first ideas about the future design of regional policy after 2013 in the fifth cohesion report .
the event is the last major milestone before the Commission presents legislative proposals by the summer .
speaking ahead of the meeting , Committee of the Regions President Mercedes Bresso stressed : &quot;
our message is clear : we want to ensure that cohesion policy has the resources it needs after 2013 to continue the process of reducing the economic , social and territorial disparities between Europe &apos;s regions .
cohesion policy remains crucial because of its method of involving Europe &apos;s regions , cities and social partners , because it &apos;s a sign of Europe &apos;s solidarity with the less developed areas and , finally , because it stimulates additional dynamics for the single market and Europe &apos;s economy as a whole . &quot;
President Bresso underlined the practical benefits of regional aid for Europe &apos;s citizens : &quot;
in a nutshell , cohesion policy is the most visible EU intervention .
not a single European citizen can live in his city or region without seeing its benefits , either in the form of new bridges or roads , or in the form of upgraded public services .
this is Europe &apos;s added value . &quot;
the CoR President welcomed plans to better coordinate the different European funds and to mobilise all levels of government in programme design and implementation , but cau@@ tioned : &quot;
the proposed common strategic framework has to be defined jointly by the Council and the European Parliament , together with the Committee of the Regions .
in addition , regional and local authorities have to participate in the design , negotiation and implementation of the &apos; partnership contracts &apos; . &quot;
meeting in the CoR &apos;s Commission for territorial cohesion ( CO@@ TER ) , regional and local representatives will flesh out their official response to the fifth cohesion report .
a first draft opinion was prepared by CO@@ TER chairman Michel Del@@ eb@@ arre ( FR / PES ) , Mayor of Dun@@ kir@@ k .
with almost 90 amendments tabled , Europe &apos;s mayors and regional presidents demonstrate their commitment to feeding local experience back to Brussels and providing evidence @-@ based advice for the other EU institutions .
the Committee has repeatedly stated that it sees the European Social Fund ( ESF ) as a key element of cohesion policy .
the shape of the ESF after 2013 will also be discussed this Thursday , when C@@ ati@@ us@@ cia Mar@@ ini ( IT / PES ) , President of the Umbria Region , presents her draft report on the issue .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
Europe 2020 : &quot;
warns Mercedes Bresso
this is the message she will pass on to European Council president Herman Van Rompuy , ahead of the Spring Summit .
the CoR president &apos;s message is clear : &quot; local and regional authorities were not involved in the preliminary stages or in any systematic way in preparing these national programmes . &quot;
she adds that : &quot; the first analysis of growth published by the European Commission has already highlighted the gap between the ambitions of the new strategy and the Member States &apos; initial conceptions put forward during the launch of the national reform programmes .
however , partnerships between the relevant stakeholders , with joint objectives and mutual commitments , are an essential prerequisite if these policies are to succeed . &quot;
Mercedes Bresso suggests putting cooperation between Member State governments and their cities and regions on an official basis in order to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
&quot; we want the Europe 2020 strategy to succeed , and we are jointly responsible for making this happen , &quot;
&quot; however we need to be given the resources to do this : national governments , regions , cities and other public authorities must commit themselves contractually to pursuing shared objectives .
this is where the Territorial P@@ acts come in . &quot;
this idea already has the support of the European Parliament , whose representative Lambert Van Nist@@ el@@ roo@@ ij ( EPP / NL ) has even suggested making the strategy more than just voluntary .
it was also welcomed by European Commission president José Manuel Barroso in his speech to the CoR December 2010 plenary session , as well as by Commissioner László Andor .
the Committee of the Regions is also pleased to note that several of the proposals set out in the Commission &apos;s communication on the EU budget review reflect a partnership @-@ based approach .
the representatives of 100 000 European regions and cities now expect the Member States to follow suit and take the necessary steps at their own level .
note to editors
just before the Spring Summit of the European Council , the Committee of the Regions is organising a conference with an economic theme on territorial dialogue , to be attended by participants from the European institutions and local and regional elected representatives .
local and regional authorities are responsible for over 30 % of total public expenditure , 25 % of tax revenue , 16 % of public debt and two @-@ thirds of capital investment .
they also implement around 70 % of European law .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
&quot; the European Commission cannot do without analyses of the impact of its proposals at local and regional level in Europe .
what is at stake here is the effectiveness and legitimacy of EU action . &quot;
the Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the principle of subsidiarity , the definition of which now includes a specific reference to the local and regional dimension .
without their involvement and commitment the principle of subsidiarity would remain a dead letter . &quot;
this is why Mercedes Bresso welcomed the strong involvement of the representatives of regional parliaments at the conference .
in this connection , the Committee of the Regions has established a Subsidi@@ arity Monitoring Network to ensure that the experience of those who do the day @-@ to @-@ day work of applying European legislation is fed back to Brussels .
follow this link for more information on defence of the subsidiarity principle and this conference .
the conclusions of the meeting are also available .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
freedom of movement and discrimination : the CoR paints a mixed picture of European citizenship
&quot; in the new multicultural context , citizenship must no longer be seen merely in terms of protecting identity and belonging , but as a point of integration and social inclusion . &quot;
the day &apos;s event saw CoR members focus on European citizenship and the draft opinion on the EU Citizenship Report 2010 drawn up by Roberto P@@ ella ( IT / EPP ) , a Member of Val@@ den@@ go Municipal Council .
Roberto P@@ ella added , however , that although the rights referred to in this report applied only to EU citizens they also represented fundamental rights , which meant that they &quot; also applied to third @-@ country nationals . &quot;
according to Commissioner Viviane Reding , local and regional authorities can play a major role in identifying the problems which the people of Europe face every day in terms of exercising their rights .
you are the first to be in a position to ensure that local government officials responsible for implementing the rights of European citizens have sufficient knowledge of the applicable European rules .
she added : &quot;
Europe is decided in Brussels but is acted out where you live .
I therefore feel that it is vital to establish a direct dialogue between the Commission , the CoR and the associations of local and regional authorities to examine the issue of European citizenship .
we must draw ideas from you that work at local level and build on your specialist local knowledge . &quot;
Roberto P@@ ella , who is also responsible for youth affairs at the National Association of Italian Municip@@ alities ( AN@@ CI ) believes that local and regional bodies can allow the European institutions to reach those groups that are the least involved in the European debate , such as young people and immigrants .
the CoR &apos;s members endorsed the European Commission &apos;s plans to designate 2013 as the European Year of Citizens , pointing out that local and regional authorities represented an appropriate level of government for launching initiatives aimed at &quot; training in European citizenship &quot; both for school pupils and adults .

press Release
the EU &apos;s Assembly of Regional and Local Representatives
for the CoR , &quot; tomorrow &apos;s EU must have a credible , 10 @-@ year budget capable of reacting to new needs of interest to Europe &quot;
&quot; the EU must have a credible budget , more than 1 % of GDP , if it is to achieve the objectives that the Member States have set it .
the EU budget after 2013 represents a multi @-@ billion euro stake in the development of European cities and regions through the cohesion policy , among other things .
this is why the Committee of the Regions wanted to hear what the European Commissioner for the Budget and Financial Planning , Janusz Lewandowski , had to say before the Commission fin@@ alises its proposals , which are announced for 29 June .
confirming its 2008 opinion that called for the duration of the programme to be extended to 10 years ( 5 + 5 ) , the CoR made several proposals , including the creation of reserves for review and flexibility to make the EU budget more responsive without losing sight of the need to respond to new needs of interest to Europe .
the quest for new own resources reflects the approach of sound public management .
the European budget belongs to the people of Europe and , as such , should be able to be financed directly . &quot;
for the CoR , all funds with a territorial dimension , such as the ERDF , the ESF , the Cohesion Fund , the EAFRD and the EFF should be grouped under one heading . &quot;
